edition. Karen Callas and Alicia Smallbrock assured vital clerical support. Several
colleagues, including Andrew Barnes, Erick Langer, Michael Adas, Donald Sutton and
Abraham Marcus, provided very useful suggestions. I wish to thank also what is now
several generations of world history students at George Mason University, whose
interest and good ideas continue to motivate and educate me.

INTRODUCTION
Comparative World History
This book advances an understanding of world history and develops two of the
essential skills the study of world history should promote: the ability to deal with
primary sources and the ability to compare important aspects of major societies.
Primary sources—documents and other materials prepared at various times and
places in the world’s history—offer a distinctive means of understanding the nature
of the past. They invite readers to put themselves in other people’s shoes—to
consider patterns of thinking and behavior different from our own. They also teach
skills in assessment, interpretation, and the construction of arguments from data that
can be applied to contemporary materials as well. Figuring out the meaning of
diverse materials indeed connects history directly to contemporary analysis.
Comparison is also vital. World historians are eager to discuss contact among
major societies and the operation of global forces such as trade or migration. But
they also must provide the means of improving our understanding of these partially
separate patterns, as well as diverse reactions to common forces. Comparison forces
decisions about what is really distinctive about a society and what is shared—
perhaps beneath the surface of superficial differences.
Unlike textbooks, this collection does not seek fully comprehensive coverage. It
deals with various aspects of the human experience, from government to gender
systems, but it does not treat each aspect of every major society. The book does
work to establish a sense of change over time, along with document assessment and
comparison. Materials are organized according to key periods in world history so
that readers can use sources and comparisons to discuss changing world frameworks.
Major societies initially operated in considerable isolation, and this pattern requires
comparison around similar functions but separate origins. Traces of this separateness
persist to this day. The reasons why twentieth-century China embraced Communism
but the Middle East did not go back, in part, to distinctions in cultures and political
systems established 1,500–2,500 years ago, when these regions formed their own
identities. With the passage of time—and particularly from about 500 C.E.* onward—
major societies accelerated mutual contacts and exchanges. By the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries contacts intensified still further. Even in the twentieth century,
however, reactions to global contacts varied in the major civilizations, making
comparison a vital analytical method in ongoing world history.
Primary Sources
The first emphasis is on primary sources, that is, documents written for the time and
not intended, like a textbook, to explicitly inform current college students of world
history. These primary sources, drawn from religious treatises, government
pronouncements, economic regulations, and the like, require careful interpretation
in order to figure out their historical significance. The sources must be not only
read; they must also be assessed and recombined so that they can be used to answer
historical questions that go beyond merely repeating what the document said. Thus,
a religious passage intended to define morality might be used to ask questions about
gender—basic views concerning men and women—that the author was not fully

aware of. Or a company record listing the daily obligations of factory workers might
be expected to reveal fundamental assumptions about the nature of work. Through
sources of this sort, the volume deals with various facets of modern civilizations in
Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, ranging from the growth of governments and
the impact of new science to the formation of novel work systems and the
development of intense loyalties such as nationalism.
Reading a primary source requires some creative imagination because the
thinking behind it will almost never be just like your own. Words that appear to be
the same as ours may have different meanings. It’s useful to ask of each source,
What are the key assumptions here, and which ones require the biggest stretch from
current habits of thought? Different kinds of sources involve different interpretive
tasks. Some are accounts of events; they need to be assessed for possible bias. Others
are documents in action, such as a declaration of war or a treaty. These can be
evaluated for assumptions, but a bias test is less relevant. In every case there is some
subtlety of meaning to be discovered, with the aid of the contexts provided in the
introductory notes to each chapter. The results can reach more deeply into the
notions of past societies than any other type of reading.
*The designation C.E. means “of the common era”; B.C.E means “before the common
era.” B.C.E. technically starts from the beginning of time and moves to the
conventional date for the birth of Christ. Many world historians prefer this term to
the Christian B.C. (“before Christ”), but it covers the same time period, as do C.E. and
the Christian A.D. (anno domini or “in the year of the Lord”). The first century B.C.E.
(100–1 B.C.E.) comes right before the first century C.E. (1–100); there was no year
zero.
Grouping the materials in comparative settings actually helps focus the task of
analyzing their meaning. Documents can be read to determine what two or more
societies had in common, in an area such as religion or slave-holding, and what
differentiated them. They also reveal how differently major societies can operate
and still be “successful.” The documents themselves do not do the task of comparing,
for with rare exceptions they were not written with another society in the mind. But
comparison can guide the task of deriving meaning. Documents on Mexican and
Russian revolution, for example, invite interpretations that will produce a sense of
what some of the central features of modern revolution were—and also a sense of
how the two movements differed around the common dynamic.
World History and Civilizations
Studying world history involves examining the evolution of major individual
societies or civilizations. Major civilizations include those such as China or Western
Europe that generated certain shared cultural values and political forms and that
were usually organized around strong internal trading networks. Each civilization, in
other words, established some coherence that gave its members a certain sense of
identity—an ability to determine that other societies were different, that members of
other civilizations were “outsiders”—and that created more intense internal than
external contacts, for example, in commercial exchanges. A major civilization did
not necessarily have a single government—it might be composed of many separate
kingdoms or nations—but its regions or nations, even when rivalrous, nevertheless
shared certain values. Thus, Western Europe has almost always been politically
divided, often convulsed in internal wars, yet it has gained some common features
through its participation in Christianity and more modern shared cultures like

science and mutual trade.
The evolution of major societies is not the only subject of world history.
Important international developments, such as sweeping contagious diseases,
migrations, missionary religions, and world trade, affect individual societies
powerfully, and these developments demand careful attention in their own right. Yet
international factors are usually handled through the institutions and beliefs of the
individual civilizations. An epidemic disease thus may be interpreted quite
differently by two separate societies, even though objectively it is the same disease,
with approximately the same physical consequences. International trade
opportunities may affect all societies, but some, because of prior culture, will
attempt to limit the impact of such trade while others will embrace the opportunity
to gain new contacts. Global factors, in other words, need to be understood as they
filtered through partially separate civilizations—even when they reduced the
distinctiveness and isolation of those civilizations.
The list of major civilizations in world history, defined in terms of what a
civilization is (a form of human organization having economic surplus, formal
government, and so on) and in terms of special size and importance, contains some
standard entries. China, India, and the Muslim Middle East/North Africa are on any
list. So is Western Europe. Many centers of civilization formed in Africa south of the
Sahara, a vast territory; they had some features in common, and so references to
sub-Saharan African civilization are standard in world history, even though the
category embraces a great deal of diversity. The Asian, European, and African
civilizations were established well before 1450, but their separate trajectories
continued to exercise a powerful influence on world history thereafter. Latin
American civilization, emerging from the mixture of Spanish/Portuguese, American
Indian, and African elements, created a distinct identity, building in part on earlier
American Indian civilizations such as the Mayans, the Aztecs, and the Incas. The
basic list of major civilizations, by the sixteenth century, thus includes at least six
entries, most of them already quite old, with one, Latin America, just taking shape.
Inevitably issues of definition emerge. Same regions reflect influence from large
civilizations but retain distinctive features of their own: should Japan or Korea be
seen as separate societies, or as part of a larger East Asian civilization strongly
touched by China? Are the United States or Australia new civilizations or part of a
larger Western complex? Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia also raise key
definitional questions, as they blend their own experiences with outside influence.
Finally, key areas were not embraced by a single civilization at all, at least until
modern times. The vast nomadic territories of central Asia form a particularly
important case in point. Comparison helps shape our understanding of many key
issues in defining societies and regions.
Comparing Societies
Comparison is a standard form of human thought. We often try to understand
individual entities better by comparing them with something else we know. To take
a very simple example, person X gains identity and recognizability when we see that
she is taller than person Y. The same gains accrue from comparing societies. The
United States, to take another fairly simple example, is often called a violent society.
By itself, that statement is hard to assess. It acquires meaning only if we compare
rates of violence—murders per capita, for example—with those of other societies.
And in fact, compared to Western Europe, the United States is a violent society. But

—and here comparison obviously becomes more complex, for it entails questions
about what comparisons are most revealing and relevant—compared with Latin
America the United States is fairly violent but not extremely so.
Virtually every characteristic we use to identify societies assumes some
comparative standard. China is usually portrayed in world history as having a
relatively centralized government and a tendency to scorn outside cultures. These
features can be traced by charting the evolution of Chinese history all by itself, but
they gain real meaning only if we compare Chinese politics and cultural receptivity
to another case, such as that of India (which comparison reveals that the
characterizations are accurate on the whole).
Without comparison, world history risks becoming a list of developments in one
place, followed by a list of developments in another, and on and on without much
meaning. Comparison, actively juxtaposing major civilizations, helps us know what
particularly to look for and appreciate about each case. It also sets up other
analytical tasks. Causation is one: if China is more centralized politically than India,
in most periods of world history, including today, then why—what other factors in
the two societies help explain the initial difference and then explain why it was
perpetuated? Impact is the second: what difference does it make, in family life or
beliefs, for example, that China is usually more centralized politically than India?
(One twentieth-century answer is birthrate: because China has frequently used
government to regulate society in the past, its policies toward birthrate limitations
have been far more rigorous and successful than those of India.) Comparing major
civilizations stands at the core of making sense of world history, by relating the
identities of the civilizations and clarifying questions of causation and impact.
Comparison even helps chart the real results of that other principal strand of
world history: international crosscutting. Why does one civilization respond
differently to the arrival of religious missionaries, or a new military technology, or a
major epidemic, than does another? In modern history, comparing differences
between African and Indian reactions to Western influences is an obvious way to
deal with one of the major international forces of modern times, as soon as we
realize that although Western influence has some common components, its actual
impact varies considerably from case to case across the world.
Comparison generates better understanding. But it is not always an easy analytical
assignment. Using the readings in each section of this book requires some vital
analytical habits, and questions in each chapter will apply these habits to the
materials presented. The comparer faces several key issues:
1. Comparison must be active. There is sometimes an impulse to describe one
society, and then describe another, and assume that the comparison has been made.
Not so. Comparison requires that the two cases be brought together, so that the
comparer makes direct statements about how Muslim family structure, for example,
compares to Christian. If a facet of one society is discussed, it must be discussed for
the other as well, for otherwise comparison is impossible. Comparison may require
some separate descriptions of each case by way of background, but ultimately, at the
heart of the presentation, direct juxtaposition is essential. In comparing
documentary sources of the sort presented in this book, this means that it is not
enough simply to summarize one document and then another; they must be
explicitly brought together.
2. Comparison must allow for similarities as well as differences. This is obvious, but
sometimes it is tempting to stress differences above all. Major civilizations often had

a lot in common, in part because they experienced similar global influences. The
trick in comparison is to figure out what the balance between similarity and
difference is, and not to overdraw contrasts.
3. Comparison involves a sensible choice of cases. Comparing the importance of
palm trees in Jamaica and in northern Ontario is possible but silly—the contexts are
too different to provide any useful meaning. Comparing Russian and American
concerns about dieting in the mid-twentieth century is also silly, beyond an initial
finding that Russians, worried mainly about finding enough food, did not develop a
systematic diet culture during the decades in which Americans worried about the
subject incessantly. The most revealing comparisons involve societies that have
enough in common that exploring differences really gets to the heart of some major
distinctions between the two cases.
In the chapters of this book, that test has been imposed: total disparities are not
presented, because they are not very informative. This is one reason why, societies
are compared in the same time period. Comparing industrial Japan with early
Mesopotamian civilizations would quickly reveal huge differences, starting with
technology, but it would not be as useful as comparing Mesopotamia with its early
civilization neighbor Egypt, or the Japanese version of industrial society with that of
Germany. Even with relatively precise comparative choices, there is always room for
debate. In the violence example presented above, which comparison is more useful if
the goal is to understand the United States? Europe is Americans’ standard historical
reference, because a (shrinking) majority of Americans are of European origin and
because many Americans think of Europe as the measure of all things civilized. But
perhaps choosing Latin America, another society with a strong and recent frontier
tradition, is actually more revealing. Here, selection of the cases is complex and
invites open discussion. It will be well to keep in mind, while studying the chapters
of this book, what other comparative sets might have been useful in dealing with the
phenomenon in question.
4. Comparison involves a decision about how many cases to compare. Comparing
two cases, Christianity and Islam, is easier than adding a third, Buddhism.
Sometimes a three-way comparison may be helpful, for example, in showing that
two cases, which look rather different when compared with each other, actually
have some striking similarities when an even more distinctive case is brought into
the picture. Christianity and Islam, for example, are quite similar religions (and for
good historical reason), compared with Buddhism, even though Christians and
Muslims often like to emphasize their mutual differences and dislikes. (Disliking
another society is not proof of difference; often the societies that are most similar
particularly dislike each other because they need to establish separate identities.)
5. Comparison involves flexibility and imagination. In comparing, be alert for
revealing, if unfamiliar, subjects, and don’t be surprised when comparisons don’t
produce the results that a preliminary comparative sense might lead one to
anticipate. Take an unexpected comparative finding as a challenge to explore
further. Compared to all other societies in the world today, the United States has
more people in jail per capita. How and why has the nation generated this
distinctive feature? The answer, even though the category is not a very standard
component of our assessment of American history, could be very revealing. Another
comparative topic: France has a rich history of fascination with fancy cooking and
foods. Butter-based cooking entered French dining as early as the seventeenth
century. The United States historically has been much more conscious of nutritional
aspects of food (reformers were discussing this as early as the 1830s, hence new

products like the graham cracker and Kellogg’s cereals). So which society produces
the lower percentage of overweight people? The answer: France, hands down. The
average French person has lost an average of about two pounds between 1940 and
1990 while the average American has gained eight, height held constant. This is on
the surface an unexpected comparative finding, which should then dictate a search
for the reasons, given a comparative food history that perhaps ought to have
produced the opposite results.
Using Documents and Comparisons in Teaching and Learning World History
Many world history courses already use documents and comparisons, which was one
reason the first edition of this book proved useful. The standards of the new
Advanced Placement program in world history, which emphasize both primary
source analysis and comparison, also testify to the importance of the skills this
collection promotes.
It is also true, however, that introducing comparative analysis of sources into
some world history programs remains challenging. The topics in this collection are
designed to fit, and enhance, much standard coverage. Each chapter is introduced in
ways that help connect the material to fundamental themes in the world history
course—to discussions of the nature of government in the classical period, for
example, or of the evolution of labor systems in Latin America. Emphasis on the
major societies of Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, and organization in terms
of the standard world history time periods, additionally facilitates integration with
other reading and classroom work. Materials in the final section, on the
contemporary period in world history, invite assessment in terms of earlier patterns
and traditions, where world history past actively conditions world history present.
Using the Book
Each section of this book opens with an introduction to the main characteristics of
the time period in world history. The introductions explain how the ensuing chapter
topics relate to basic patterns and why the comparative selections make sense in
terms of the activities emphasized—trade, or religion, or gender—and in terms of
the specific civilizations included.
Each chapter also has an introduction, identifying the comparative topic and the
societies involved and placing both in world history context. This introduction also
explains how the civilizations selected are significant for the topic—why classical
China and Greece, for example, should be compared politically, or why Indian
religions should be compared with religions that arose in the Middle East.
After the introduction to each chapter, a set of questions raises some of the
specific comparative issues that can be found in the documents that follow. A final
set of questions, “For Further Discussion,” presents wider comparative issues that can
be handled partially from the documents but that need further comparative
information—from textbooks or other historical studies or, sometimes, from other
chapters in this book.
Questions in the first segment, before “For Further Discussion,” can be answered
from the documents. Looking at the questions first can help guide the reading of the
documents, and then the questions should be reexamined after the documents have
been read. The questions apply to a particular topic—the conditions of women in
Africa and Latin America, for example, using the comparative approaches discussed

above. They thus ask about similarities as well as differences and about causes and
impacts of comparative features (calling for imaginative extensions). And they
promote direct comparison rather than a mere sequencing of data from one
civilization to the next.
Finally, each document or document set has a brief heading that gives details
about the time, the place, and the authorship of the document or documents. The
context supplied by this information should be included in assessing the document’s
meanings and in preparing for the comparisons.

PART I

River Valley Civilizations, 3500–1000 B.C.E., and the Classical Period,
1000 B.C.E.–450 C.E.
THE EARLY RIVER VALLEY civilizations formed in the Middle East, North Africa, India, and

China. (Later, the expansive classical civilizations developed both in these regions
and beyond.) Early civilizations and their classical successors set up important
cultural and institutional characteristics that had enduring influence, providing vital
topics for comparative analysis.
Early Cultures and the Early Civilization Period
The early civilization period began around 3500 B.C.E. in the Tigris-Euphrates valley
in the northern Middle East. Early civilization periods in other regions, also for the
most part based in river valleys exploited for irrigation as well as transportation,
had somewhat different dates. Egypt developed from about 3000 B.C.E. onward, China
from 1500, and the first civilizations in Central America (the Olmecs) from about
800 B.C.E. No civilization could emerge without the prior development of agriculture.
For historians studying early cultures and civilizations, a key problem is the lack
of abundant sources. Many important cultures, with well-defined belief systems and
elaborate rules for behavior, never generated writing. Furthermore, much writing
has been destroyed over time, and writing on stone tablets or bones was so laborious
that it was not very widespread in any event.
The first chapter, as a result, deals with only a few topics, but those are
fundamental to early societies. The writings of early civilizations must be asked
questions that they were not explicitly designed to answer. Law codes, for example,
provide our only real evidence about family patterns and social structures, even
though these topics were not formally laid out. Only after the nature of the evidence
is assessed can comparison among belief systems or civilization forms be attempted.
The Classical Period, 1000 B.C.E.–450 C.E.
Between 1000 and 500 B.C.E., several civilization centers began to transcend the
patterns of river valley societies. Using iron tools and weapons, governments
conquered new territories and economies generated new opportunities for regional
trade and specialization. The twin themes in this period were civilization expansion,
from river valley origins to much larger regions, and territorial integration. As
societies grew geographically, they had to find ways to form a region into a
coherent trade area; into a roughly common cultural zone where elites, at least,
would share some basic ideas and art forms; and—at times—into a single political
unit. Major classical civilizations arose in India, China, and the Mediterranean, with
a fourth center in Persia. All of these regions created political empires that sought
considerable political unity as part of the integration—though the durability of the
empires varied considerably. Everywhere, a series of new invasions, occurring
between the third and the sixth centuries C.E., introduced disruptions that ended the
classical period.
With the classical period opportunities for comparison among the civilizations
increase. Developments in this period—the emergence of Confucianism in China and
the religious emphases of classical India, for example—set an enduring framework
for the areas involved, which makes comparison all the more significant. Some of

the differences between India and China today go back to contrasts that first became
apparent in the classical centuries.
The major classical civilizations built on the precedents of the river valley centers,
but their territories were larger and their cultural systems were more formal. They
used some earlier ideas, including those of the polytheistic religions, but they shaped
more systematic statements. Thus, in India a priestly, polytheistic religion evolved
into Hinduism. China produced Confucianism as a unifying cultural approach, at
least for much of the upper class. Political institutions expanded. All the major
centers formed huge empires, at least during key portions of the classical period. In
China the imperial form became the standard political framework. Commercial
exchange increased. Social structures perpetuated inequalities that had undoubtedly
started earlier but were now more formalized, more fully integrated with beliefs and
political practices. Thus, India developed its caste system, and the Mediterranean
region relied considerably on slavery. The same formalization applies to gender
relations, where the assumptions of patriarchy were spelled out more fully.
In politics, in diverse cultural expressions, and in social forms, the classical
civilizations shared important characteristics. They were all rooted in agricultural
economies in which trade was expanding. They all faced the task of integrating
larger territories into a common civilization orbit, and this required innovation in
political institutions and ideas and in cultural forms. The classical civilizations even
had some mutual contacts—more, on the whole, than the more isolated river valley
civilizations had maintained. Greek and Indian civilizations encountered each other
in the fourth century B.C.E. through the conquests of Alexander the Great; the result
was some mutual imitation of ethical ideas, artistic forms, and mathematics. Later in
the classical period, Chinese trade with India brought knowledge of Buddhism, and
Chinese pilgrims journeyed to India to learn more. Trade routes took Chinese silk as
far west as the Roman Empire.
On the whole, however, the key developments of the classical period took place
separately, with each civilization putting a distinctive stamp on its social, political,
and cultural forms. Rome received Chinese silk, but it knew almost nothing about
China, and the converse was true as well. Separateness was compounded by a
heightened sense of identity. As the Greeks or the Chinese developed their societies,
they became proudly aware of how different (and, usually, inferior) other peoples
were. Separate historical patterns and a concern for identity add up to an obvious
comparative challenge. As in the early civilization period, comparison most
obviously focuses on how key civilizations differed, even as they addressed common
themes such as the presumed inferiority of women. Explaining why the differences
arose and what impact they had extends this comparative analysis. Comparison
highlights the distinctive traditions and identities that were taking shape in the
classical period and that would echo later on. But comparison can also tease out
some of the common features, even when the leaders of the principal civilizations
were unaware of them.

CHAPTER 1
CREATION STORIES
Many societies—probably the vast majority—generate explanations of how the
world began, or at least how humans began. Such explanations are often part of a
larger religious outlook.
Comparing creation stories raises key issues about beneath-the-surface similarities,
including, of course, why so many otherwise distinctive societies felt a similar need
to account for origins.
The variations among the stories are significant too, suggesting different specific
religious beliefs and different ideas about the relationship between humans and
other aspects of nature.
The following stories come from the Americas, from Africa, and from the Middle
East. Three—Babylonian, Egyptian, and Mayan—derive from early civilizations. Two
are from hunting and gathering groups, recently recorded though of much older
origin. In addition to one-to-one comparisons, the collection may suggest different
kinds of groupings that will assist further comparative analysis.
Questions
1. What are the most important differences among the stories? Are the differences
significant or superficial?
2. What do the stories have in common? Is it possible to identify similar elements in
the origins beliefs of early human societies?
3. Do the stories group together in meaningful ways? Do the stories from early
civilizations share elements that differentiate them from the hunting and gathering
stories? Are there common elements in terms of geography?
For Further Discussion
1. What might have caused significant differences among the stories?
2. How do the stories compare to those of major religions, like Christianity and
Islam? Are they very different, and if so why?
3. In addition to comparing features and causes, is it historically useful to evaluate
comparatively? Are some of the stories better or more satisfying than others? On
what basis can you judge?
4. Is it possible to infer significant characteristics of a society from a creation story?
Does a story suggest distinctive religious beliefs or attitudes toward nature?
A Kabyl Story
This story comes from the Kabyl peoples of the Sahara; a nomadic group, they live
in what is now Morocco and Algeria. It is not known when this oral legend first
developed, or what other influences it reflected (the Kabyl are now Muslims).
•••
In the beginning there were only one man and one woman and they lived not on the
earth but beneath it. They were the first people in the world and neither knew that
the other was of another sex. One day they both came to the well to drink. The man

said: “Let me drink.” The woman said: “No, I’ll drink first. I was here first.” The man
tried to push the woman aside. She struck him. They fought. The man smote the
woman so that she dropped to the ground. Her clothing fell to one side. Her thighs
were naked.
The man saw the woman lying strange and naked before him. He saw that she
had a vagina. He felt that he had a penis. He looked at the vagina and asked: “What
is that for?” The woman said: “That is good.” The man lay upon the woman. He lay
with the woman eight days.
After nine months the woman bore four daughters. Again, after nine months, she
bore four sons. And again four daughters and again four sons. So at last the man and
the woman had fifty daughters and fifty sons. The father and mother did not know
what to do with so many children. So they sent them away.
The fifty maidens went off together towards the north. The fifty young men went
off together towards the east. After the maidens had been on their way northwards
under the earth for a year, they saw a light above them. There was a hole in the
earth. The maidens saw the sky above them and cried: “Why stay under the earth
when we can climb to the surface where we can see the sky?” The maidens climbed
up through the hole and onto the earth.
The fifty youths likewise continued in their own direction under the earth for a
year until they, too, came to a place where there was a hole in the crust and they
could see the sky above them. The youths looked at the sky and cried: “Why remain
under the earth when there is a place from which one can see the sky?” So they
climbed through their hole to the surface.
Thereafter the fifty maidens went their way over the earth’s surface and the
youths went their way and none knew aught of the others.
At the time all trees and plants and stones could speak. The fifty maidens saw the
plants and asked them: “Who made you?” And the plants replied: “The earth.” The
maidens asked the earth, “Who made you?” And the earth replied, “I was already
here.” During the night the maidens saw the moon and the stars and they cried:
“Who made you that you stand so high over us and over the trees? Is it you who give
us light? Who are you, great and little stars? Who created you? Or are you, perhaps,
the ones who have made everything else?”…
A NORTH AMERICAN VERSION
THE HAIDA STORY1

The Haida are a Native American people in the Canadian Northwest, along the
Pacific coast of what is now British Columbia.
•••
Then one day the water began to fall, and at last even the thin spit of sand now
known as Rose Spit lay dry. The Raven flew there and found it covered by clams,
cockles, rock oysters, crabs, scallops, sea cucumbers, abalone, red turbans, sea
urchins, mussels in their dark blue mantle, and fish of all kinds left behind by the
falling water. For a long time, he did nothing but eat, gorging himself on these delic
acies. But at last even his gluttony was satisfied and he began to think of the other
things he liked doing, playing tricks, changing things so the world would not settle
down to a boring routine.

There certainly was not much to play with or change on this deserted beach, with
no companions except the rapidly expiring sea creatures left stranded there. The
Raven walked along getting more bored and restless by the minute.
He had almost decided to fly away to some more interesting spot even if it meant
leaving all this lovely ripe food behind, but decided there must be something more
on this beach. So he continued his stroll, calling out in frustration now and then.
“This is a fine place for food,” he said, and “I must say that the big bright ball, the
Sun I stole from the old man and hung up there in the sky is a big improvement. But
there certainly is not much to do here.” He threw back his head and called to the
empty sky in his loudest voice, “Isn’t there anybody anywhere?” Almost immediately
he heard an answering cry which seemed to come from far beneath him. At first he
saw nothing, except a remarkably large clamshell half buried in the sand.
“I have seen lot of clams in my time,” he said, “but the most noise they have been
able to make was a sort of squishy sound. So this is at least a different kind of
clam.” He leaned closer and saw that the shell was an old one and that its original
occupant had long since departed. It was now filled with a mass of squirming
creatures all trying to hide from the enormous black shape that seemed intent on
destroying them.
1 From Leo Frobenius and Douglas Fox, African Genesis (New York: Benjamin Blair,
1966), 49–50.
If the Raven had not eaten so much so recently, the little creatures might have
become part of his dinner, and the world would have been a much different place.
But his curiosity at the moment was much stronger than his appetite. So instead of
picking up the shell and dropping it on a rock to break it open, he very gently, using
his most charming and seductive voice, a lovely bell-like croon, certainly one of the
most beautiful sounds in the world, which seems to come from the roots of the
mountains, from the wellsprings of the sea, from the caves where the winds are
born, he coaxed the little creatures to come out of their shell. He told them of the
land that waited for them, covered the great red cedar trees from which they could
build their big houses and seagoing canoes, and in time tall totem poles to
commemorate their great deeds. He sang of the restless seas, which every year would
bring the salmon to the rivers and are the home of the great whales, the porpoises,
the seals and sea lions, the sea otters and all the fish, which would feed them
through their time on earth.
So with much hesitation, afraid but unable to resist, they finally came out.
Very strange creatures they were: two legs like the Raven, but no shiny feathers on
their bodies or wings. In fact no wings at all, just long thin appendages which
moved constantly. Except for their shiny black hair on their round heads, they were
naked, quite the strangest creatures the Raven had ever seen—these first people—
who were to become Haida.
For a long time the Raven amused himself with his new playthings, teaching the
men and women all kinds of clever tricks: how to build the beautiful Haida canoes
which took them on fishing and sea hunting trips, and, as they grew in numbers, to
visit and trade or go to war with their neighbors.
He watched the children grow up and have children of their own, and the old
people die. He watched some of them become chiefs and some slaves, and he saw
the chiefs prove how great they were by building great houses, beautifully decorated
with carvings telling of their heraldic pasts, and filled with exquisite ceremonial

works of art to be used at the great winter feasts. He watched them dance and
listened to them sing, and enjoyed the stories they told, particularly those about
him.
It was a fine game he played with the little people from the clamshell, and it
lasted for many centuries.
A BABYLONIAN STORY
This story comes from a tablet found in the ruins of the city of Ashur, dating back to
approximately 800 B.C.E. It was a version of an older Sumerian story. It provided
names for the first humans, Ulligarra and Zalgarra, and implied that they were
divine to some degree—created from divine blood possibly mixed with clay.
•••
Another Account of the Creation of Man2
A tablet discovered among the ruins of the city of Ashur and dating back to
approximately 800 B.C. gives us still another version of the creation of man. This text
consists of three columns. The first contains signs which are held by some to be
musical notes but which are most likely symbols of some kind of secret writing; the
second contains the Sumerian version of the story of man’s creation; and the third
offers the Babylonian translation of it. On this tablet mention is made for the first
time in Babylonian-Assyrian literature of the first two human beings and their
names, Ulligarra and Zalgarra. Before each one’s name is placed the sign for “deity,”
which means that the first ancestors of mankind were regarded as being divine at
least to some degree. The reason for this conception lies, of course, in the fact that
they were thought to have been created with divine blood, which, according to other
sources, was mixed with clay.

THE MAYAN STORY, FROM POPOL VUH
Popol Vuh was a Council Book used as a source of advice for Mayan leaders in
Quiche, a center in present-day Guatemala, around 1000 C.E. (The only existing
document was written in the sixteenth century after the Spanish conquest.) The book
was used to guide decisions and interpret omens. The book included a creation story
dealing with the origins of the planets, animals, even ball games—as well as
humans.
•••
The Mayan Story of Human Creation from Popol Vuh4
And here is the beginning of the conception of humans, and of the search for the
ingredients of the human body. So they spoke, the Bearer, Begetter, the Makers,
Modelers named Sovereign Plumed Serpent:
“The dawn has approached, preparations have been made, and morning has come
for the provider, nurturer, born in the light, begotten in the light. Morning has come
for humankind, for the people of the face of the earth,” they said. It all came
together as they went on thinking in the darkness in the night, as they searched and
they sifted, they thought and they wondered.
And here their thoughts came out in clear light. They sought and discovered what
was needed for human flesh. It was only a short while before the sun, moon, and
stars were to appear above the Makers and Modelers. Broken Place, Bitter Water
Place is the name: the yellow corn, white corn came from there.
And these are the names of the animals who brought the food: fox, coyote, parrot,
crow. There were four animals who brought the news of the ears of yellow corn and
white corn. They were coming from over there at Broken Place, they showed the
way to the break.
And this was when they found the staple foods.
And these were the ingredients for the flesh of the human work, the human
design, and the water was for the blood. It became human blood, and corn was also
used by the Bearer, Begetter.
And so they were happy over the provisions of the good mountain, filled with
sweet things, thick with yellow corn, white corn, and thick with pataxte and cacao,

countless zapotes, anonas, jocotes, nances, matasanos, sweets the rich foods filling
up the citadel named Broken Place, Bitter Water Place. All the edible fruits were
there: small staples, great staples, small plants, great plants. The way was shown by
the animals.
And then the yellow corn and white corn were ground, and Xmucane did the
grinding nine times. Corn was used, along with the water she rinsed her hands with,
for the creation of grease; it became human fat when it was worked by the Bearer,
Begetter, Sovereign Plumed Serpent, as they are called.
After that, they put it into words:
the making, the modeling of our first mother-father,
with yellow corn, white corn along for the flesh,
food alone for the human legs and arms,
for our first fathers, the four human works.
It was staples alone that made up their flesh.

•••
These are the names of the first people who were made and modeled.
This is the first person: Jaguar Quitze.
And now the second: Jaguar Night.
And now the third: Mahucutah.
And the fourth: True Jaguar.
And these are the names of our first mother-fathers. They were simply made and
modeled, it is said; they had no mother and no father. We have named the men by
themselves. No woman gave birth to them, nor were they begotten by the builder,
sculptor, Bearer, Begetter. By sacrifice alone, by genius alone they were made, they
were modeled by the Maker, Modeler, Bearer, Begetter, Sovereign Plumed Serpent.
And when they came to fruition, they came out human:
They talked and they made words.
They looked and they listened.
They walked, and worked.
They were good people, handsome, with looks of the male kind. Thoughts came
into existence and they gazed; their vision came all at once. Perfectly they saw,
perfectly they knew everything under the sky, whenever they looked. The moment
they turned around and looked around in the sky, whenever they looked. The
moment they turned around and looked around in the sky, on the earth, everything
was seen without any obstruction. They didn’t have to walk around before they
could see what was under the sky; they just stayed where they were.
As they looked, their knowledge became intense. Their sight passed through trees,
through rocks, through lakes, through seas, through mountains, through plains.
Jaguar Quitze, Jaguar Night, Mahucutah, and True Jaguar were truly gifted people.
And then they were asked by the builder and mason:
“What do you know about your being? Don’t you look, don’t you listen? Isn’t your
speech good, and your walk? So you must look, to see out under the sky. Don’t you
see the mountain-plain clearly? So try it,” they were told.

And then they saw everything under the sky perfectly. After that, they thanked the
Maker, Modeler:
“Truly now,
double thanks, triple thanks
that we’ve been formed, we’ve been given
our mouths, our faces,
we speak, we listen,
we wonder, we move,
our knowledge is good, we’ve understood
what is far and near,
and we’ve seen what is great and small
under the sky, on the earth.
Thanks to you we’ve been formed,
we’ve come to be made and modeled,
our grandmother, our grandfather,”
they said when they gave thanks for having been made and modeled. They
understood everything perfectly, they sighted the four sides, the four corners in the
sky, on the earth, and this didn’t sound good to the builder and sculptor:
“What our works and designs have said is no good:
‘We have understood everything, great and small,’ they say.” And so the Bearer,
Begetter took back their knowledge:
“What should we do with them now? Their vision should at least reach nearby,
they should see at least a small part of the face of the earth, but what they’re saying
isn’t good. Aren’t they merely ‘works’ and ‘designs’ in their very names? Yet they’ll
become as great as gods, unless they procreate, proliferate at the sowing, the
dawning, unless they increase.”
“Let it be this way: now we’ll take them apart just a little, that’s what we need.
What we’ve found out isn’t good. Their deeds would become equal to ours, just
because their knowledge reaches so far. They see everything,” so said
the Heart of Sky, Hurricane,
Newborn Thunderbolt, Raw Thunderbolt,
Sovereign Plumed Serpent,
Bearer, Begetter,
Xpiyacoc, Xmucane,
Maker, Modeler,
as they are called. And when they changed the nature of their works, their designs, it
was enough that the eyes be marred by the Heart of Sky. They were blinded as the
face of a mirror is breathed upon. Their eyes were weakened. Now it was only when
they looked nearby that things were clear.
And such was the loss of the means of understanding, along with the means of
knowing everything, by the four humans. The root was implanted.
As such was the making, modeling of our first grandfather, our father, by the
Heart of Sky, Heart of Earth.

CHAPTER 2
COMPARING LAWS
The Importance of the State
Codes of law were a common product of relatively early civilizations. The following
two selections reflect the development of written laws, associated with the
operations of organized government. The first known code is that of the Babylonian
emperor Hammurabi, issued around 1700 B.C.E. Jewish law, ultimately written as
part of the Bible, particularly in the book of Deuteronomy, developed later,
beginning about 950 B.C.E.
Law codes do much more than simply define crimes and punishments. They reveal
beliefs about religion, the family and the nature of the state. Comparing codes can
indicate deep-seated contrasts and commonalities between societies, though they
must be interpreted beyond literal meanings. Comparison is a vital means of getting
at some of the key characteristics of early civilizations.
Law codes in early civilizations shared many features—indeed, in defining crimes
such as murder, they share features with modern codes as well. Codes worked
toward replacing private feuds and violence with government-sponsored justice, for
example—though early states often failed to enforce such edicts. Mesopotamian law
surely influenced Jewish codes, for the Jewish state was often under Mesopotamian
control. A surprising array of laws dealing with gender and regulating sexual
behavior, particularly for women, characterized both systems, though in Judaism the
rules were slightly harsher and the concern for limited protective rights slightly less
well developed. Law in both societies reflected the small bureaucracies of the early
states—hence a concern for punishing false testimony, in the absence of extensive
investigatory police forces, and an emphasis on harsh punishments designed to deter
crime. Provisions in both societies also expressed some interest in protecting general
social welfare, for example, in trying to assure wages for work or (in the
Mesopotamian case) reimbursing for loss in crime—a notion still being debated in
the United States.
The two codes displayed crucial differences as well, reflecting different religious
cultures and political institutions. Mesopotamian law stressed the power of the state,
though sanctioned by gods such the creator Marduk and a polytheistic religion. In
contrast, Jewish law was seen as emanating from Jehovah, in the world’s first real
monotheistic religion. Did this difference in framework show up in the laws
themselves and in efforts to assure obedience?
Questions
1. How did Babylonian law try to reconcile the needs of the state with the fact that
it could not afford a large, professional bureaucracy? How did the state use
“volunteers”? How did it arrange for public works?
2. What protections did women have in Babylonian law? How do these compare
with the stipulations for women in Jewish law? How can we tell that both
societies were patriarchal?
3. How many social classes did Babylonia have? Was Jewish law different in its
approach to the poorer classes?
4. What were the key differences between Babylonian and Jewish religions?

5. What are the sources claimed for the law in the two societies? How did the
differences in these claims relate to differences in the roles of priests and
government officials?
6. What are the main similarities between the two law codes?
For Further Discussion
1. How did both law codes differ from modern ideas of law?
2. What might have caused the key differences between Jewish and Babylonian law?
MESOPOTAMIA: HAMMURABI’S CODE
The Babylonians were an invading people who reunited the city states of
Mesopotamia by conquest. The victorious king, Hammurabi, reigned for forty-three
years, earning a reputation for justice and efficiency. His law code, from around
1700 B.C.E., consisted of 282 case laws written on a stone slab; it was discovered in
1901 in Iran. The code does not represent a carefully articulated philosophy of law
or the state, but rather highlights selected decisions the king and his officials
rendered for the purpose of providing precedents for just rulings.

The righteous laws, which Hammurabi, the wise king, established and [by which]
he gave the land stable support and pure government. Hammurabi, the perfect king,
am I….
The great gods proclaimed me and I am the guardian governor, whose scepter is
righteous and whose beneficent protection is spread over my city….

The king, who is pre-eminent among city kings, am I. My words are precious, my
wisdom is unrivaled….
If that man do not pay attention to my words which I have written upon my
monument: if he forget my curse and do not fear the curse of god: if he abolish the
judgments which I have formulated, overrule my words, alter my statues, efface my
name written thereon and write his own name: on account of these curses,
commission another to do so—as for that man, be he king or lord, or priest-king or
commoner, whoever he may be, may the great god, the father of the gods, who has
ordained my reign, take from him the glory of his sovereignty, may be break his
scepter, and curse his fate!…
JEWISH LAW
Jewish settlers established a small kingdom along the eastern Mediterranean
between 1200 and 1100 B.C.E. The people may have developed elements of their
religion and culture earlier—this is what is claimed in the initial stories of the Old
Testament, particularly the book of Exodus. Jewish culture was marked by its
elaborate, intense religion, which featured the first durable articulation of
monotheistic beliefs but also laws and religious rules of behavior. Most of the book
of Deuteronomy, from which the following passages come, was written in the
seventh century B.C.E., though elements of the laws themselves had undoubtedly
developed earlier.
•••
You must be entirely faithful to Yahweh your God…. [A]nd Yahweh said to me….
“The man who does not listen to my words that he speaks in my name, shall be held
answerable to me for it. But the prophet who presumes to say in my name a thing I
have not commanded him to say, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that
prophet shall die.”
You may say in your heart, “How are we to know what word was not spoken by
Yahweh?” When a prophet speaks in the name of Yahweh and the thing does not
happen and the word is not fulfilled, then it has not been spoken by Yahweh.
If anyone has struck his fellow accidentally, not having any previous feud with
him (for example, he goes with his fellow into the forest to cut wood; his arm
swings the axe to fell a tree; the head slips off the handle and strikes his companion
dead), that man may take refuge in one of these cities and save his life. It must not
be allowed that the avenger of blood, in the heat of his anger, should pursue the
killer … for the man has not deserved to die, having had no previous feud with his
companion….
But if it happens that a man has a feud with his fellow and lies in wait for him
and falls on him and wounds him fatally and he dies, and the man takes refuge in
one of these cities, the elders of his own town shall send to have him seized and
hand him over to the avenger of blood to die. You are to show him no pity. You
must banish the shedding of innocent blood from Israel, and then you will prosper.

Boundaries

You must not displace your neighbour’s boundary mark, set by your forbears, in the
inheritance you receive in the land Yahweh is giving into your possession.
Witnesses
A single witness cannot suffice to convict a man of a crime or offence of any kind;
whatever the misdemeanour, the evidence of two witnesses or three is required to
sustain the charge.
If a malicious witness appears against a man to accuse him of rebellion, both
parties to this dispute before Yahweh must be brought before the priests and judges
then in office. •The judges must make a careful inquiry, and if it turns out that the
witness who accused his brother is a lying witness, •you must deal with him as he
would have dealt with his brother. You must banish this evil from your midst.
•Others will hear of it and be afraid and never again do such an evil thing among
you. •You are to show no pity.

Captured Towns
When you advance to the attack on any town, first offer it terms of peace. If it
accepts these and opens its gates to you, all the people to be found in it shall do
forced labour for you and be subject to you….
When you go to war against your enemies and Yahweh your God delivers them
into your power and you take prisoners, •if you see a beautiful woman among the
prisoners and find her desirable, you may make her your wife •and bring her to your
home. She is to shave her head and cut her nails •and take off her prisoner’s garb;
she is to stay inside your house and must mourn her father and mother for a full
month. Then you may go to her and be a husband to her, and she shall be your wife.
•Should she cease to please you, you will let her go where she wishes, not selling her
for money: you are not to make any profit out of her, since you have had the use of
her.…
If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not listen to the voice of his
father or the voice of his mother, and even when they punish him still will not pay
attention to them, •his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him out
to the elders of the town at the gate of that place. •And they shall say to the elders
of his town, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious and will not listen to us; he
is a wastrel and a drunkard.” •Then all his fellow citizens shall stone him to death.
You must banish this evil from your midst. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid.…
If a man marries a wife, and sleeps with her and then turns against her, and taxes
her with misconduct and publicly defames her by saying, “I married this woman and
when I slept with her I did not find the evidence of her virginity,” the girl’s father
and mother must take her and produce the evidence of her virginity before the
elders of the town at the gate. •The girl’s father shall then declare to the elders, “I
gave this man my daughter for a wife and he has turned against her, •and now he
taxes her with misconduct: I found no evidence of virginity in your daughter, he
says. But the evidence of my daughter’s virginity is here.” And they shall spread the
cloth out before the elders of the town. •Then the elders of the town shall take the
man and flog him •and fine him one hundred silver shekels for publicly defaming a
virgin of Israel, and give this money to the girl’s father. She shall remain his wife

and as long as he lives he may not repudiate her.
But if the accusation that the girl cannot show the evidence of virginity is
substantiated, •they shall take her to the door of her father’s house and her fellow
citizens shall stone her to death for having committed an infamy in Israel by
disgracing her father’s House. You must banish this evil from your midst.…
You must not allow a master to imprison a slave who has escaped from him and
come to you. •He shall live with you, among you, wherever he pleases in any one of
your towns he chooses; you are not to molest him.…
You are not to exploit the hired servant who is poor and destitute, whether he is
one of your brothers or a stranger who lives in your towns. •You must pay him his
wage each day, not allowing the sun to set before you do, for he is poor and is
anxious for it; otherwise he may appeal to Yahweh against you, and it would be a
sin for you.…
When reaping the harvest in your field, if you have overlooked a sheaf in that
field, do not go back for it. Leave it for the stranger, the orphan and the widow, so
that Yahweh your God may bless you in all your undertakings.…
When two men are fighting together, if the wife of one intervenes to protect her
husband from the other’s blows by putting out her hand and seizing the other by the
private parts, •you shall cut her hand off and show no pity.…
If you do not keep and observe all the words of this Law that are written in this
book, in the fear of this name of glory and awe: Yahweh your God, •Yahweh will
strike you down with monstrous plagues, you and your descendants: with plagues
grievous and lasting, diseases pernicious and enduring. •Once more he will bring on
you the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will infect you. Further,
Yahweh will bring on you every sickness, every plague, not mentioned in the Book of
this Law, until you perish. •There will be only a handful of you left, you who were as
many as the stars of heaven.

CHAPTER 3
POLITICAL IDEALS IN CHINA AND GREECE
Political life and the state were basic features of both Chinese and Mediterranean
civilization in the classical period. Both civilizations had a strong secular emphasis,
with provision of appropriate political order a vital component of successful
societies and with appropriate service to the state a vital component of the good life.
But the forms of government and the specific political ideals differed greatly.
Political institutions and values are central topics for the classical period, when
governments expanded and key civilizations established durable characteristics.
Comparison highlights both similarities and differences in this core feature of
classical societies. Precisely because the classical societies developed largely
separately, comparison provides vital analytical links while calling attention to basic
issues in the period as a whole.
Confucianism was the most important single political philosophy developed in
classical China; it has enduring influence on Chinese thought and politics even to the
present day. Confucius (551–476 B.C.E.) developed his emphases on the state, stable
social hierarchy, and social and personal order at a time of disunity and strife in
China. He claimed to be restoring traditional Chinese values, and a concept of
balance may well have permeated Chinese culture from an earlier period, supporting
the Confucian emphasis on personal restraint. By the time of the Han dynasty (202
B.C.E.–220 C.E.), however, emperors understood the importance of Confucian thinking
in supporting the government and providing guidelines for the training of a growing
bureaucracy.
In contrast to classical China under the Han dynasty, Athens was not a great
empire, though it gained colonies. Rather, it was a Greek city-state. Like other citystates in the divided, mountainous peninsula, Athens generated an aristocratic
government early on, after 800 B.C.E. But then it went through other political phases,
some of which entailed greater involvement of ordinary citizens. By the fifth
century, Athens had developed an extensive participatory democracy for those who
did have full rights. It also became a leading commercial center and was the site of
one of the most vibrant outpourings of art, literature, and philosophy the world has
ever known. Pericles, the principal leader of Athens after the mid-fifth century, was
an aristocrat who usually operated behind the scenes of the bustling democracy. He
was well aware of his city’s diverse strengths. Pericles’ Funeral Oration, issued by
Athens’s main democratic leader (though of aristocratic origin) during the early
stages of the Peloponnesian War (between Athens and Sparta, 431–404 B.C.E.), sought
to lay out the chief qualities of Athenian democracy.
Confucianism and Athenian democracy demonstrate the great diversity possible in
the development of classical societies. Confucianism served a strong, durable empire,
with the world’s first explicitly educated, centralizing bureaucracy. Not surprisingly,
Confucian values and China’s government forms were repeatedly revived and, in East
Asia, widely imitated, for they provided the most successful political formula
devised by any civilization until modern times. Periclean Athens, in contrast, failed
after exhaustion and defeat in the war with Sparta. Later societies in the
Mediterranean retained a democratic element and certainly a high esteem for
cultural achievements, but aristocratic or authoritarian rule became more common.

Yet the Periclean ideal, because it was so vividly stated in Thucydides’ history and
because it was associated with such unusual achievements in art and philosophy, did
not die. It became part of a complex Greek legacy to later societies, including those
of Western Europe and North America much later, when conditions ripened for a
different kind of political democracy.
Questions
1. What political values do Pericles and Confucius share? Would they agree at all on
the features of a good government, a good family, or a good servant of the state?
2. What are their main differences, and how would these show up in the way the two
societies organized their governments and in what individuals expected from the
state? How would Confucius react to the idea of a democracy? What kind of
personality training does each passage suggest?
3. Both Pericles and Confucius discuss social inequality, directly or indirectly, along
with gender and the role and use of wealth. What are the main differences in
social views, and how do these relate to the larger political styles? How would
Pericles and Confucius debate the role of merchants in a well-arranged society?
How would they defend social and economic inequality?
For Further Discussion
1. Does the comparison between these two great classical leaders suggest any reason
why Confucianism had much greater importance in Chinese history than Pericles
and his ideas gained in the larger history of the classical Mediterranean
civilization and its successors?
2. How did Confucian and Greek ideas about proper human behavior and the
importance of political goals compare with the emerging ideas of Hinduism?
3. What changes had occurred in Greek politics by Pericles’ time? What were the
continuities in political and social values?
4. Why did some early Chinese leaders dislike Confucianism?
CONFUCIANISM: CHINESE POLITICAL VALUES
The following Confucian passage is entitled “The Great Learning.” Its origin is
uncertain. It may have been written by Confucius himself, but possibly some early
followers devised it in the Confucian spirit. The passage was certainly completed by
200 B.C.E. It gained further importance from the attention given to it by a later, neoConfucian philosopher, Chu Hsi (1120–1200 C.E.), and by the fourteenth century C.E.
it had become a standard part of China’s civil service examination.
•••
The Way of learning to be great (or adult education) consists in manifesting the
clear character, loving the people, and abiding (chih) in the highest good.
Only after knowing what to abide in can one be calm. Only after having been
calm can one be tranquil. Only after having achieved tranquillity can one have
peaceful repose. Only after having peaceful repose can one begin to deliberate. Only
after deliberation can the end be attained. Things have their roots and branches.
Affairs have their beginnings and their ends. To know what is first and what is last
will lead one near the Way.
The ancients who wished to manifest their clear character to the world would
first regulate their families. Those who wished to bring order to their states would

first regulate their families. Those who wished to regulate their families would first
cultivate their personal lives. Those who wished to rectify their minds would first
make their wills sincere. Those who wished to make their wills sincere would first
extend their knowledge. … when the mind is rectified, the personal life is cultivated;
when the personal life is cultivated, the family will be regulated; when the family is
regulated, the state will be in order; and when the state is in order, there will be
peace throughout the world. From the Son of Heaven [the Emperor] down to the
common people, all must regard cultivation of the personal life as the root or
foundation. There is never a case when the root is in disorder and yet the branches
are in order.…

The Book of Odes says, “How profound was King Wen! How he maintained his
brilliant virtue without interruption and regarded with reverence that which he
abided (chih).” As a ruler, he abided in humanity. As a minister, he abided in
reverence. As a son, he abided in filial piety. As a father, he abided in deep love. And
in dealing with the people of the country, he abided in faithfulness.
The Book of Odes says,…“How grave and how dignified” indicates precaution.
“How majestic and distinguished” expresses awe-inspiring appearance. “Here is our
elegant and accomplished prince. We can never forget him” means that the people
cannot forget his eminent character and perfect virtue. The Book of Odes says, “Ah!
the ancient kings are not forgotten.” [Future] rulers deemed worthy what they
deemed worthy and loved what they loved, while the common people enjoyed what
they enjoyed and benefited from their beneficial arrangements. That was why they
are not forgotten even after they passed away.…
Confucius said, “In hearing litigations, I am as good as anyone. What is necessary
is to enable people not to have litigations at all.” Those who would not tell the truth
will not dare to finish their words, and a great awe would be struck into people’s
minds. This is called knowing the root.…
What is meant by “making the will sincere” is allowing no self-deception, as when
we hate a bad smell or love a beautiful color. This is called satisfying oneself.
Therefore the superior man will always be watchful over himself when alone. When
the inferior man is alone and leisurely, there is no limit to which he does not go in
his evil deeds. Only when he sees a superior man does he then try to disguise
himself, concealing the evil and showing off the good in him. But what is the use?
For other people see him as if they see his very heart. That is what is meant by
saying that what is true in a man’s heart will be shown in his outward appearance.
Therefore the superior man will always be watchful over himself when alone.…
What is meant by saying that in order to govern the state it is necessary first to
regulate the family is this: There is no one who cannot teach his own family and yet
can teach others. Therefore the superior man (ruler) without going beyond his
family, can bring education into completion in the whole state. Filial piety is that
with which one serves his ruler. Brotherly respect is that with which one serves his
elders, and deep love is that with which one treats the multitude. … Therefore the
superior man must have the good qualities in himself before he may require them in
other people. He must not have the bad qualities in himself before he may require
others not to have them. There has never been a man who does not cherish altruism
(shu) in himself and yet can teach other people. Therefore the order of the state

depends on the regulation of the family.…
What is meant by saying that peace of the world depends on the order of the state
is this: When the ruler treats the elders with respect, then the people will be aroused
toward filial piety. When the ruler treats the aged with respect, then the people will
be aroused toward brotherly respect. When the ruler treats compassionately the
young and the helpless, then the common people will not follow the opposite course.
Therefore the ruler has a principle with which, as with a measuring square, he may
regulate his conduct.…
Therefore the ruler will first be watchful over his own virtue. If he has virtue, he
will have the people with him. If he has the people with him, he will have the
territory. If he has the territory, he will have wealth. And if he has wealth, he will
have its use. Virtue is the root, while wealth is the branch.…
There is a great principle for the production of wealth. If there are many
producers and few consumers, and if people who produce wealth do so quickly and
those who spend it do so slowly, then wealth will always be sufficient. A man of
humanity develops his personality by means of his wealth, while the inhumane
person develops wealth at the sacrifice of his personality. There has never been a
case of a ruler who loved humanity and whose people did not love righteousness.
There has never been a case where the people loved righteousness and yet the affairs
of the state have not been carried to completion. And there has never been a case
where in such a state the wealth collected in the national treasury did not continue
in the possession of the ruler.
ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY: PERICLES’ FUNERAL ORATION
Pericles was born about 495 B.C.E. An aristocrat who lived a polished life, his oratory
could stir the masses of Athenian citizens. He led the city, with few interruptions,
from 461 until his death in 429 and was active in advancing its empire as a source
of funds. His Funeral Oration was delivered in the winter of 431–430 to honor early
Athenian victims of the war with Sparta. A version of the speech was featured in the
History of the Peloponnesian War by the historian Thucydides, who admired Pericles
but who preferred outright aristocratic rule to what he saw as the whims of the
masses in democracy.

I shall speak first of our ancestors, for it is right and at the same time fitting, on an
occasion like this, to give them this place of honour in recalling what they did. For
this land of ours, in which the same people have never ceased to dwell in an
unbroken line of successive generations, they by their valour transmitted to our
times a free state.

And not only are they worthy of our praise, but our fathers still more; for they,
adding to the inheritance which they received, acquired the empire we now possess
and bequeathed it, not without toil, to us who are alive to-day. And we ourselves
here assembled, who are now for the most part still in the prime of life, have further

strengthened the empire in most respects, and have provided our city with all
resources, so that it is sufficient for itself both in peace and in war.…
We live under a form of government which does not emulate the institutions of
our neighbours; on the contrary, we are ourselves a model which some follow,
rather than the imitators of other peoples. It is true that our government is called a
democracy, because its administration is in the hands, not of the few, but of the
many; yet while as regards the law all men are on an equality for the settlement of
their private disputes, as regards the value set on them it is as each man is in any
way distinguished that he is preferred to public honours, not because he belongs to a
particular class, but because of personal merits; nor, again, on the ground of poverty
is a man barred from a public career by obscurity of rank if he but has it in him to
do the state a service. And not only in our public life are we liberal, but also as
regards our freedom from suspicion of one another in the pursuits of every-day life;
for we do not feel resentment at our neighbour if he does as he likes, nor yet do we
put on sour looks which, though harmless, are painful to behold. But while we thus
avoid giving offence in our private intercourse, in our public life we are restrained
from lawlessness chiefly through reverent fear, for we render obedience to those in
authority and to the laws, and especially to those laws which are ordained for the
succour of the oppressed and those which, though unwritten, bring upon the
transgressor a disgrace which all men recognize.
Moreover, we have provided for the spirit many relaxations from toil: we have
games and sacrifices regularly throughout the year and homes fitted out with good
taste and elegance; and the delight we each day find in these things drives away
sadness. And our city is so great that all the products of all the earth flow in upon
us, and ours is the happy lot to gather in the good fruits of our own soil with no
more home-felt security of enjoyment than we do those of other lands.…
For we are lovers of beauty yet with no extravagance and lovers of wisdom yet
without weakness. Wealth we employ rather as an opportunity for action than as a
subject for boasting; and with us it is not a shame for a man to acknowledge
poverty, but the greater shame is for him not to do his best to avoid it. And you will
find united in the same persons an interest at once in private and in public affairs,
and in others of us who give attention chiefly to business, you will find no lack of
insight into political matters. For we alone regard the man who takes no part in
public affairs, not as one who minds his own business, but as good for nothing; and
we Athenians decide public questions for ourselves or at least endeavour to arrive at
a sound understanding of them, in the belief that it is not debate that is a hindrance
to action, but rather not to be instructed by debate before the time comes for action.
For in truth we have this point also of superiority over other men, to be most daring
in action and yet at the same time most given to reflection upon the ventures we
mean to undertake; with other men, on the contrary, boldness means ignorance and
reflection brings hesitation.…
You must daily fix your gaze upon the power of Athens and become lovers of her,
and when the vision of her greatness has inspired you, reflect that all this has been
acquired by men of courage who knew their duty and in the hour of conflict were
moved by a high sense of honour, who, if ever they failed in any enterprise, were
resolved that at least their country should not find herself deserted by their valour,
but freely sacrificed to her the fairest offering it was in their power to give. For they
gave their lives for the common weal, and in so doing won for themselves the praise
which grows not old. … Do you, therefore, now make these men your examples, and
judging freedom to be happiness and courage to be freedom, be not too anxious

about the dangers of war. For it is not those that are in evil plight who have the best
excuse for being unsparing of their lives, for they have no hope of better days, but
rather those who run the risk, if they continue to live, of the opposite reversal of
fortune, and those to whom it makes the greatest difference if they suffer a disaster.
For to a manly spirit more bitter is humiliation associated with cowardice than
death when it comes unperceived in close company with stalwart deeds and public
hopes.…
If I am to speak also of womanly virtues, referring to those of you who will
henceforth be in widowhood, I will sum up all in a brief admonition: Great is your
glory if you fall not below the standard which nature has set for your sex, and great
also is hers of whom there is least talk among men whether in praise or in blame.

CHAPTER 4
SOCIAL INEQUALITY
All the classical civilizations paid considerable attention to organizing and justifying
extensive social inequality. But the systems of hierarchy, and the thinking behind
them, varied greatly. The two passages below discuss India’s caste system and
Roman slavery. Both documents lay out some of the fundamental features of the two
systems (in the case of the Roman legal document, the key statement comes at the
end). But both also grapple with gray areas in the systems. In the Roman case,
lawyers focused on cases in which slaves might be freed (manumitted) and what
their status would be as a result. In India, the caste system invited consideration of
what would happen if people in a given caste did work outside normal caste
boundaries, or even intermarried with another caste. Neither of these situations was
normal. That is, although manumission was common in Rome, most slaves were
never freed; and most people in India stayed within their caste boundaries. But
unusual problems can bring out underlying assumptions. How did Roman and
Indian jurists compare in their views of what social inequality was all about, how
rigid it should be, how people came to be in the lower orders (slaves or servants or
untouchables), and how inequality could be enforced? Comparison contributes to
understanding the role of social structure in the classical world.
There is much omitted from the documents. Roman law, most obviously, said
nothing about the tasks slaves did. These in fact could vary widely, from dreadful
labor in mines to household service or even tutoring upper-class children. Indian law
shows how different kinds of jobs were associated with key castes. Neither document
uncovers trends: slavery spread in Rome, undermining free labor and reducing the
motivation to improve production technology; India’s caste system, though it
became more complex and moved into additional parts of the subcontinent, was
fairly stable in essence. An omission in the Roman document even suggests one of
the tricky features of using the existence of a law as evidence of how it affected
people’s lives: the document describes an improvement in the legal protection of
slaves, which did occur as far as the law itself was concerned; what the document
does not reveal is that the treatment of slaves deteriorated as the Roman economy
came to depend more heavily on slave labor. After all, few slaves could easily invoke
the law on their own behalf.
One other complication: Roman thinking about slavery influenced later Western
slave systems, but Roman slave law obviously differed from laws in the subsequent
slaveholding societies in the Americas. Notably, there was no particular racial
element in Rome, though foreignness was a factor. Roman slavery more directly
influenced slavery in the Middle East, including the Byzantine Empire, after Rome
itself fell.
India’s castes seem to have originated when the Indo-Europeans overran previous
inhabitants of the subcontinent. Various epics (vedas) refer to the formation of
castes. The caste system was unusual in slotting people to certain social levels by
birth and regulating contact among castes as well as jobs. People could move within
castes, acquiring more or less money; but the system was fundamentally static,
justified by a religion that argued that living up to caste duties in one life prepared a
person for advancement, through reincarnation, in the next existence. The caste
system solidified over time, gradually spreading through more of India and

becoming more intricate, with scores of specific castes. The caste system persisted in
India into the twentieth century. Now outlawed, the system has left its mark: caste
origins still define considerable social barriers in Indian society. This system, in sum,
is a basic feature of Indian history.
Questions
1. What was manumission in the Roman slave system; why would it have no
applicability in India’s caste system?
2. What kind of religious arguments supported the caste system? How did Roman
law argue that slavery was compatible with justice? How is it clear, from Roman
law, that slaves did not constitute a caste?
3. Were lower castes in India more or less free than Roman slaves? How might an
Indian apologist argue that the caste system was a relatively beneficent form of
social inequality?
For Further Discussion
1. Why did classical societies uniformly develop radical social inequality, and why
were almost all major religious and political leaders comfortable in justifying it?
2. How do the Roman and Indian systems of inequality compare with systems of
inequality (and their justifications) in modern industrial societies?
3. Which would be better, in terms of quality of life: to be a Roman slave or a lowercaste Indian?
I NDIA’S CASTE SYSTEM: THE LAWS OF MANU
The Laws of Manu was written between the first century B.C.E. and the second or
third century C.E., constituting the first systematic compilation of Indian law. Early
legal statements had been extracted from the Indian epics. The Laws of Manu
maintained a close relationship with Hinduism, and indeed Manu, the creator god,
gave divine sanction to the social system. Other religious elements, such as the idea
of pollution inherent in farming because of the need to kill even small creatures,
were used to justify the laws’ social prescriptions. The Laws of Manu provided the
basic classification of the caste system, though the original four castes later
expanded greatly. Note the relationship also to views of gender and the inferiority of
women, and the low valuation of manual labor.

[87] But to protect this whole creation, the lustrous one made separate innate
activities for those born of his mouth, arms, thighs, and feet. [88] For priests, he
ordained teaching and learning, sacrificing for themselves and sacrificing for others,
giving, and receiving. [89] Protecting his subjects, giving, having sacrifices
performed, studying and remaining unaddicted to the sensory objects are… for a
ruler. Protecting his livestock… trading, lending money, and farming the land are for
a commoner. The Lord assigned only one activity to a servant; serving these [other]
classes without resentment.
[95] A ruler in adversity may also make a living by all of these (means); but he
should never be so proud as to assume the livelihood of his betters. [96] If a man of
the lowest caste should, through greed, make his living by the innate activities of his
superiors, the king should confiscate his wealth and banish him immediately. [97]
One’s own duty, (even) without any good qualities, is better than someone else’s
duty well done; for a man who makes his living by someone else’s duty immediately

falls from (his own) caste. [98] A commoner who cannot make a living by his own
duty may also subsist by the livelihood of a servant; but he must not commit actions
that (he) should not do, and he should stop when he can. [99] If a servant is unable
to engage in the service of the twice-born and is on the brink of losing his sons and

which the twice-born are served.
[101] A priest who remains on his own path and does not engage in the

livelihood, should act in keeping with the following law: [102] a priest in adversity
may accept gifts from anyone, for the assertion that ‘What is purifying can be
defiled’ is not established by law. [103] Accepting gifts from despicable people or
teaching them or sacrificing for them is not a fault in priests, for they are the equals
of fire or water. [104] A man who eats the food of anyone, no matter who, when he
is on the brink of losing his life is not smeared with evil, just as the sky is not
smeared with mud.…

[112] A priest who cannot make a living should even glean (ears of corn) and
gather (single grains) from any (field) whatsoever; gleaning is better than accepting
gifts, and gathering is preferable even to that.…
[117] Neither a priest nor a ruler should lend money at interest, but (either) may,
if he really wishes, and for religious purposes, lend at very low interest to a very evil
man.
[118] A ruler in extremity who takes even a quarter (of the crop) is free from offence if he protects his subjects to his utmost ability. [119] His own duty is
conquest, and he must not turn his back on a challenge; when he has protected the
commoner with his sword, he may collect the just tax from him: [120] the tax on
grain from the commoners is one eighth, (or) one twentieth, (or) at least one
‘scratch-penny.’ Servants, artisans, and craftsmen should give him the service of their
innate activities.…
[123] Serving priests alone is recommended as the best innate activity of a
servant; for whatever he does other than this bears no fruit for him. [124] They
should assign him a livelihood out of their own family property according to his
deserts, taking into account his ability, his skill, and the number of his dependants.
[125] They should give him the leftovers of their food, their old clothes, the spoiled
parts of their grain, and their worn-out household utensils.
[126] A servant cannot commit any crime that causes him to fall, nor does he
deserve any transformative ritual; he has no authority to carry out duties, nor is he
forbidden to carry out duties. [127] But servants who want to carry out duties, who
know duty, and who emulate the duties of good men, without reciting Vedic verses,
are not defiled but praised. [128] For the more a servant undertakes the behavior of
good men, without resentment, the more he gains this world and the next, blameless.
[129] A servant should not amass wealth, even if he has the ability, for a servant
who has amassed wealth annoys priests.

ROMAN SLAVERY
The Roman slave law evolved gradually, from the republic onward. The passage
below is from a textbook written in the second century C.E. by a jurist named Gaius.
It pulled together a great deal of prior legislation, particularly the Lex [law] Aelia
Sentia of 4 C.E., early in the empire. The text claims, of course, that wise emperors
had steadily improved the treatment of slaves. The law also reflects Roman belief in
natural laws—laws that follow from the inherent order of nature—from which manmade law derived. Finally, the code reflected the importance, and the limits, of the
status of citizen, an area in which Rome was like Athens in imposing strict
definitions. Along with the belief that slaves were property, citizenship status helped
mark off the boundaries of slave life—though, in contrast to the caste system of
India, the boundaries were not impenetrable.
•••
(1) Every community that is governed by laws and customs uses partly its own
particular law and partly the law common to all mankind. For whatever system of
justice each community establishes for itself, that is its own particular law and is
called ‘civil law’ as the law particular to that community (civitas), while that which
natural reason has established among all human beings is observed equally by all
peoples, and is called ‘law of nations’ (ius gentium) since it is the standard of justice
which all mankind observes. Thus the Roman People in part follows its own
particular system of justice and in part the common law of all mankind. We shall
note what this distinction implies in particular instances at the relevant point.…
(9) The principal distinction made by the law of persons is this, that all human
beings are either free men or slaves.
(10) Next, some free men are free-born (ingenui), others freedmen (libertini).
(11) The free-born are those who were free when they were born; freedmen are
those who have been released from a state of slavery.…
Subjects
(13) The Lex Aelia Sentia requires that any slaves who had been put in chains as a
punishment by their masters or had been branded or interrogated under torture
about some crime of which they were found to be guilty; and any who had been
handed over to fight as gladiators or with wild beasts, or had belonged to a troupe
of gladiators or had been imprisoned; should, if the same owner or any subsequent
owner manumits them, become free men of the same status as subject foreigners.…
(14) ‘Subject foreigners’ is the name given to those who had once fought a regular
war against the Roman People, were defeated, and gave themselves up.
(15) We will never accept that slaves who have suffered a disgrace of this kind can
become either Roman citizens or Latins (whatever the procedure of manumission
and whatever their age at the time, even if they were in their masters’ full
ownership); we consider that they should always be held to have the status of
subjects.

Citizens

(16) But if a slave has suffered no such disgrace, he sometimes becomes a Roman
citizen when he is manumitted, and sometimes a Latin.…
(19) A just reason for manumission exists when, for example, a man manumits in
the presence of a council a natural son, daughter, brother or sister; or a child he has
brought up, or his paedagogus [the slave whose job it had been to look after him as
a child], or a slave whom he wants to employ as his manager (procurator), or a
slave girl whom he intends to marry.
(20)… Slaves over thirty can in fact be manumitted at any time; so that
manumissions can even take place when the Praetor or Proconsul is passing by on
his way to the baths or theatre, for instance.
(21) Furthermore, a slave under thirty can become a Roman citizen by manumission
if he has been declared free in the Will of an insolvent master and appointed as his
heir [i.e. to take over the liabilities: the heres necessarius], provided that he is not
excluded by another heir.…
Digression—Subjects
(25) But those who have the status of subjects cannot receive anything at all by Will,
no more than any foreigner can, and according to the general opinion, they cannot
make a Will themselves.
(26) The lowest kind of freedom is therefore that of those whose status is that of
subjects; and no statute, Senate Recommendation or Imperial Constitution gives
them access to Roman citizenship.
(27) They are even banned from the city of Rome or anywhere within the hundredth
milestone from Rome, and any who break this law have to be sold publicly together
with their property, subject to the condition that they must never serve as slaves in
the city of Rome or within a hundred miles of Rome, and that they must never be
manumitted; if they are manumitted, the law stipulates that they become slaves of
the Roman People.…
(39) Just reasons for manumission exist where, for instance, someone manumits his
father or mother, or his paedagogus, or someone who has been brought up with him.
…
(43) Those who own more than two and not more than ten slaves are allowed to
manumit up to half the number; those who own more than ten and not more than
thirty are allowed to manumit up to a third; but those who own more than thirty
and not more than a hundred have the right to manumit up to a quarter; and finally,
those who own more than a hundred and not more than five hundred are allowed to
manumit not more than a fifth; those who own more than five hundred are not
given the right to manumit any more—the law forbids anyone to manumit more
than a hundred. But if you only own one or two slaves, you are not covered by this
law, and there are no restrictions upon your freedom to manumit.…
(52) Slaves are in the power of their owners. This power is derived from the
common law of nations, for we can see that among all nations alike owners have the
power of life and death over their slaves, and whatever is acquired by a slave is
acquired on behalf of his owner.
(53) But nowadays neither Roman citizens nor any other people who are subject to
the sovereignty of the Roman People have the right to treat their slaves with
excessive and unreasonable brutality. For a Constitution of the Divine Emperor
Antoninus orders anyone who kills his own slave without due reason to be brought

to justice in exactly the same way as one who kills another’s slave. Excessively harsh
treatment on the part of owners is also limited by a Constitution of the same
Emperor; for when certain provincial governors asked him for a ruling regarding
slaves who had taken refuge at the temples of gods or statues of emperors, he
declared that owners were to be forced to sell their slaves if the cruelty of their
behaviour appeared to be unbearable.

CHAPTER 5
CONDITIONS OF WOMEN IN THE CLASSICAL CIVILIZATIONS
China and India
Like the early civilizations, all the classical centers of civilization were patriarchal
societies, in which women were treated as inferiors to men and, in some respects, as
their property. Materials from China and India abundantly illustrate women’s
inferiority. They also obviously contrast with predominant modern values, where
inequality is at least more contested. Yet, it is important not to oversimplify classical
patriarchy. Women were not absolutely powerless. By observing certain behaviors
and by using various private or even public recourses available to them, they might
gain partial control over their condition. This important complexity in patriarchy
also emerges from presentations of women in the laws and literature of classical
societies. Of course, these materials offer only partial insight into women’s real lives;
they suggest standards for women more than real behaviors, and their relevance
varied with social class. Even the cultural discussions of women, however, suggest
how some women might use existing standards to their benefit or, by force of
personality, might even defy the standards to some degree. The discussions also
demonstrate important disagreements within classical societies, even among
dominant men, over exactly how women should be treated. Here, it is particularly
important to assess the extent to which defenders of women really offered different
evaluations of women’s rights and qualities—a particularly interesting issue in
Rome.
Paying attention to women in world history presents some challenges, in part
because of lack of sources, in part because women’s inferior conditions hinder an
understanding of their potential range of activity. Comparison helps show
differences as well as similarities in patterns of inferiority, opening the topic for
more sophisticated analysis.
Each of the classical societies offered a somewhat different version of patriarchal
inequality. Chinese materials reflect the Confucian emphasis on hierarchy and on
order, while also illustrating certain opportunities for informal expression for
women within this system. In India women’s conditions were more commonly
portrayed in terms of religion and intense emotion, with an emphasis on moral duty
but also more frequent reference to attachments through love and beauty.
The selections that follow constitute cultural evidence—beliefs held by men and
at least some women—of women’s inferiority and separate roles. Culture is very
powerful, and that helps explain why women, taught ideas of these sorts from
girlhood, might accept their distinct conditions. But culture is not the only story of
women and gender relations. Societies also have birthrates, specific work
assignments, and educational systems, all of which may be influenced by beliefs but
which also may vary or change for other reasons. These parts of the picture also
affect women powerfully. We lack details in many of these areas for the classical
period, which is one reason for relying on cultural documentation. Furthermore,
cultures not only helped shape actual conditions but also tended to persist, which
explains why ideas formed in classical civilizations lasted so long. One of the
Chinese documents cited below, from a manual by the upper-class woman author
Ban Zhao, was still being used to educate women in China as late as the nineteenth

century.
Questions
1. Did any of the classical cultures authorize men to think they could treat women
any way they saw fit?
2. How do Chinese ideas about women reflect larger Confucian values? How do
Indian ideas mirror larger religious and social beliefs? (Note: Indian thinkers
disagreed about whether women would need to be reincarnated as men to reach a
higher spiritual plane.)
3. What would Chinese and Indian thinkers agree about, where women are
concerned? Where would they disagree? Did their ideal women embody the same
characteristics? Which society produced greater emphasis on factors such as
emotion and love in describing relations between men and otherwise inferior
women?
4. Standards for women produced measurements of inadequacy. How do the Indian
and Chinese materials differ in suggesting why a husband might want to reject a
wife?
5. What hints do the following materials give about how women could survive in
classical, patriarchal societies? What kinds of women had the most power?
(Answering this question provides an important clue to the lives of many real
women in patriarchal families.) Could women make any claims to fair treatment
in any of the societies? How could a Chinese woman make a case, within the
cultural system, that she was not getting what she needed to fulfill her obligations
as a woman? Could Roman or Indian women make such a case, and would it
resemble China’s?
For Further Discussion
1. Why did patriarchal conditions develop so widely? Why didn’t women rebel
against them?
2. Why was there less gender inequality in the lower classes than in the upper classes
in the classical period?
3. Judging by the cultural standards, were women better off in classical India or
classical China.
4. What other kinds of evidence, besides stories and prescriptions, is essential to
evaluating women’s conditions in the past?
CHINA: “MOTHER OF MENCIUS” AND BAN ZHAO
Chinese authors paid considerable attention to women during the Han dynasty. The
following three selections show various facets of patriarchal beliefs: the devoted
mother, a bad wife, and a standard statement of women’s characteristics and duties.
Do they fit together consistently? The first selection is from Biographies of Heroic
Women written by the eminent scholar Liu Xiang in about 79–78 B.C.E. Mencius was
a Confucian philosopher who lived from about 372 to 289 B.C.E. and who was widely
revered. Because he was left fatherless, his mother played a great role in raising him,
and the stories about her provided standard examples of maternal ideals. The second
selection is from the most famous Han text on women’s virtue, by Ban Zhao (ca. 45–
116 C.E.); she was a prominent woman scholar whose own life would seem to
contradict the values she preached.

•••
THE MOTHER OF MENCIUS

The mother of Mencius lived in Zou in a house near a cemetery. When Mencius was
a little boy he liked to play burial rituals in the cemetery, happily building tombs
and grave mounds. His mother said to herself, “This is no place to bring up my son.”
She moved near the marketplace in town. Mencius then played merchant games
of buying and selling. His mother again said, “This is no place to bring up my son.”
So once again she moved, this time next to a school house. Mencius then played
games of ancestor sacrifices and practiced the common courtesies between students
and teachers. His mother said, “At last, this is the right place for my son!” There they
remained.

York: Free Press, 1993), 72–74. Copyright © 1993 by Patricia Buckley Ebrey.

Publishing Group.
When Mencius grew up he studied the six arts of propriety, music, archery,
charioteering, writing, and mathematics. Later he became a famous Confucian
scholar. Superior men commented that Mencius’s mother knew the right influences
for her sons. The Book of Songs says, “That admirable lady, what will she do for
them!”
When Mencius was young, he came home from school one day and found his
mother was weaving at the loom. She asked him, “Is school out already?”
He replied, “I left because I felt like it.”
His mother took her knife and cut the finished cloth on her loom. Mencius was
startled and asked why. She replied, “Your neglecting your studies is very much like
my cutting the cloth. The superior person studies to establish a reputation and gain
wide knowledge. He is calm and poised and tries to do no wrong. If you do not
study now, you will surely end up as a menial servant and will never be free from
troubles. It would be just like a woman who supports herself by weaving to give it
up. How long could such a person depend on her husband and son to stave off
hunger? If a woman neglects her work or a man gives up the cultivation of his
character, they may end up as common thieves if not slaves!”
Shaken, from then on Mencius studied hard from morning to night. He studied the
philosophy of the master and eventually became a famous Confucian scholar.
Superior men observed that Mencius’s mother understood the way of motherhood.
The Book of Songs says, “That admirable lady, what will she tell them!”
After Mencius was married, one day as he was going into his private quarters, he
encountered his wife not fully dressed. Displeased, Mencius stopped going into his
wife’s room. She then went to his mother, begged to be sent home, and said, “I have
heard that the etiquette between a man and a woman does not apply in their private
room. But lately I have been too causal, and when my husband saw me improperly
dressed, he was displeased. He is treating me like a stranger. It is not right for a
woman to live as a guest; therefore, please send me back to my parents.”
Mencius’s mother called him to her and said, “It is polite to inquire before you
enter a room. You should make some loud noise to warn anyone inside, and as you
enter, you should keep your eyes low so that you will not embarrass anyone. Now,

you have not behaved properly, yet you are quick to blame others for their
impropriety. Isn’t that going a little too far?”
Mencius apologized and took back his wife. Superior men said that his mother
understood the way to be a mother-in-law.
When Mencius was living in Qi, he was feeling very depressed. His mother saw
this and asked him, “Why are you looking so low?”…
Mencius answered, “I have heard that the superior man judges his capabilities and
then accepts a position. … Today my ideas are not being used in Qi, so I wish to go
somewhere else. But I am worried because you are getting too old to travel about
the country.”
His mother answered, “A woman’s duties are to cook the five grains, heat the
wine, look after her parents-in-law, make clothes, and that is all! Therefore, she
cultivates the skills required in the women’s quarters and has no ambition to
manage affairs outside of the house. The Book of Changes says, ‘In her central place,
she attends to the preparation of the food.’ The Book of Songs says, ‘It will be theirs
neither to do wrong nor to do good, / Only about the spirits and the food will they
have to think.’ This means that a woman’s duty is not to control or to take charge.
Instead she must follow the ‘three submissions.’ When she is young, she must submit
to her parents. After her marriage, she must submit to her husband. When she is
widowed, she must submit to her son. These are the rules of propriety. Now you are
an adult and I am old; therefore, whether you go depends on what you consider
right, whether I follow depends on the rules of propriety.”
Superior men observed that Mencius’s mother knew the proper course for women.
The Book of Songs says, “Serenely she looks and smiles, / Without any impatience
she delivers her instructions.”
BAN ZHAO’S ADMONITIONS FOR WOMEN

Humility
In ancient times, on the third day after a girl was born, people placed her at the base
of the bed, gave her a pot shard to play with, and made a sacrifice to announce her
birth. She was put below the bed to show that she was lowly and weak and should
concentrate on humbling herself before others. Playing with a shard showed that she
should get accustomed to hard work and concentrate on being diligent. Announcing
her birth to the ancestors showed that she should focus on continuing the sacrifices.
These three customs convey the unchanging path for women and the ritual
traditions.
Humility means yielding and acting respectful, putting others first and oneself
last, never mentioning one’s own good deeds or denying one’s own faults, enduring
insults and bearing with mistreatment, all with due trepidation. Industriousness
means going to bed late, getting up early, never shirking work morning or night,
never refusing to take on domestic work, and completing everything that needs to be
done neatly and carefully. Continuing the sacrifices means serving one’s husbandmaster with appropriate demeanor, keeping oneself clean and pure, never joking or
laughing, and preparing pure wine and food to offer to the ancestors.
There has never been a woman who had these three traits and yet ruined her
reputation or fell into disgrace. If a woman loses these three traits, she will have no
name to preserve and will not be able to avoid shame.

Devotion
According to the rites, a man is obligated to take a second wife but nothing is
written about a woman marrying twice. Hence the saying, “A husband is one’s
Heaven: one cannot flee Heaven; one cannot leave a husband.” Heaven punishes
those whose actions offend the spirits; a husband looks down on a wife who violates
the rites and proprieties. Thus the Model for Women says, “To please one man is her
goal; to displease one man ends her goal.” It follows from this that a woman must
seek her husband’s love—not through such means as flattery, flirting, or false
intimacy, but rather through devotion.…
If a husband be unworthy then he possesses nothing by which to control his wife.
If a wife be unworthy, then she possesses nothing with which to serve her husband.
If a husband does not control his wife, then the rules of conduct manifesting his
authority are abandoned and broken. If a wife does not serve her husband, then the
proper relationship (between men and women) and the natural order of things are
neglected and destroyed. As a matter of fact the purpose of these two (the
controlling of women by men, and the serving of men by women) is the same.
Now examine the gentlemen of the present age. They only know that wives must
be controlled, and that the husband’s rules of conduct manifesting his authority
must be established. They therefore teach their boys to read books and (study)
histories. But they do not in the least understand that husbands and masters must
(also) be served, and that the proper relationship and the rites should be maintained.
Yet only to teach men and not to teach women,—is that not ignoring the essential
relation between them? According to the “Rites,” it is the rule to begin to teach
children to read at the age of eight years, and by the age of fifteen years they ought
then to be ready for cultural training. Only why should it not be (that girls’
education as well as boys’ be) according to this principle?… As Yin and Yang are not
of the same nature, so man and woman have different characteristics. The distinctive
quality of the Yang is rigidity; the function of the Yin is yielding. Man is honored for
strength; a woman is beautiful on account of her gentleness. Hence there arose the
common saying: “A man though born like a wolf may, it is feared, become a weak
monstrosity; a woman though born like a mouse may, it is feared, become a tiger.”
Now for self-culture nothing equals respect for others. To counteract firmness
nothing equals compliance. Consequently it can be said that the Way of respect and
acquiescence is woman’s most important principle of conduct. So respect may be
defined as nothing other than holding on to that which is permanent; and
acquiescence nothing other than being liberal and generous. Those who are steadfast
in devotion know that they should stay in their proper places; those who are liberal
and generous esteem others, and honor and serve (them).
From Nancy Lee Swan, Panchao : Foremost Woman Scholar of China (New York:
Century Company, 1932), 82–87.
If husband and wife have the habit of staying together, never leaving one another,
and following each other around within the limited space of their own rooms, then
they will lust after and take liberties with one another. From such action improper
language will arise between the two. This kind of discussion may lead to
licentiousness. Out of licentiousness will be born a heart of disrespect to the
husband. Such a result comes from not knowing that one should stay in one’s proper
place.
Furthermore, affairs may be either crooked or straight; words may be either right

or wrong. Straightforwardness cannot but lead to quarreling; crookedness cannot
but lead to accusation. If there are really accusations and quarrels, then undoubtedly
there will be angry affairs. Such a result comes from not esteeming others, and not
honoring and serving (them).
(If wives) suppress not contempt for husbands, then it follows (that such wives)
rebuke and scold (their husbands). (If husbands) stop not short of anger, then they
are certain to beat (their wives). The correct relationship between husband and wife
is based upon harmony and intimacy, and (conjugal) love is grounded in proper
union. Should actual blows be dealt, how could matrimonial relationship be
preserved? Should sharp words be spoken, how could (conjugal) love exist? If love
and proper relationship both be destroyed, then husband and wife are divided.
INDIA: THE RAMAYANA
The following excerpts are from a great Indian epic, the Ramayana, attributed to an
author named Valmiki. It was written in Sanskrit during the third century B.C.E., but a
more definitive version was compiled around 200 C.E. The story deals with the
turbulent life of a god-king, Rama, and his wife, Sita. Rama is driven into exile, and
his wife insists on accompanying him. Sita is abducted and Rama battles successfully
to win her back. The story provides a host of complex clues about marriage ideals in
India’s version of a patriarchal society. One reference, to an ordeal by burning,
foreshadows a custom (suttee) introduced in a later period of Indian history,
according to which some women were expected to throw themselves on their
husbands’ funeral pyres, based on the assumption that with her husband dead, a
woman’s life was over.

227; 3: 103–4, 287–89, 310–16, 334–38, 341–42.
The sweet-speaking Sita, worthy of Rama’s love, thus being instructed to remain in
Ayodhya, though filled with affection, indignantly replied: “O Offspring of a great
king, O Rama, how canst thou speak in such wise? O Prince, thy words evoke
laughter. O Chief of Men, father, mother, son and daughter-in-law live according to
their merit and are dependent on it, but a wife enjoys the fortune of her husband
since she is a part of himself. I am therefore entitled to share thy father’s command
and also go into exile.
“The happiness of a woman depends on her husband, neither father, mother, son,
relative or companion avail her at death; in this world and in the other world, the
husband alone is her all-in-all. If thou to-day depart for the forest, I will precede
thee on foot, clearing the thorns and kusha grass from thy path. O Hero,
relinquishing anger and pride, take me with thee without hesitation. There is no
fault in me that merits my remaining here, without thee. The joy experienced by
lords of men whether dwelling in a palace or transported in an aerial chariot
through the heavens or possessing the eightfold psychic powers, is far inferior to the
joy of the wife in the service of her lord. My royal father has instructed me fully in
the duties of a wife and, therefore, I have no need of further instruction in the
matter. Assuredly I shall accompany thee to the forest, uninhabited by men, filled
with savage beasts, such as bears and bulls. O My Hero, I will dwell in the forest as
happily as in the palace of my father, having no anxiety in the three worlds save the
service of my spouse. O Hero, I will wander with thee in the forest according to the
ancient spiritual ordinance, free from desire for pleasure, traversing the honey-

scented woodland. O Lord of my Life, since thou canst protect and support
innumerable people, canst thou not more easily protect me? Without doubt to-day I
shall enter the forest with thee, O Fortunate Prince, none can break my resolve.…
Thus Sita, lamenting and embracing… Rama, wept aloud. From her eyes, like a
she elephant wounded by poisoned arrows, long-restrained tears issued, as fire is
kindled by the friction of wood. Crystal drops fell from her eyes as water slips from
the petals of the lotus flowers. The face of the princess resembling the full moon,
withered by the fire of intense grief, looked like a lotus withdrawn from water.
Shri Ramachandra, taking Sita, afflicted and fainting, in his arms, spoke to her in
the following wise: “O goddess I do not desire even to enter heaven if it causes thee
pain! Nought do I fear! Like Brahma [the creator God], I am wholly fearless!
Though able to protect thee in every way, yet not fully knowing thy mind, I declined
to let thee share my exile. Seeing thou art destined to share my exile, I do not desire
to abandon thee, as a man of virtuous conduct determines not to sacrifice his good
name.…
This is eternal righteousness—to obey the command of thy parents, fixed in the
practice of truth. O Sita, not knowing thy mind, I advised thee not to accompany
me, but now seeing thy fixed resolve I desire to take thee with me.… [During the
exile Sita is seized by a king, Ravana, aided by a demon. Rama ultimately defeats
Ravana.]
Rama Repudiates Sita
Beholding Sita standing humbly beside him, Rama gave expression to the feelings he
had concealed in his heart, saying:—
“O Illustrious Princess, I have re-won thee and mine enemy has been defeated on
the battlefield; I have accomplished all that fortitude could do; my wrath is
appeased; the insult and the one who offered it have both been obliterated by me.
To-day my prowess has been manifested, to-day mine exertions have been crowned
with success, to-day I have fulfilled my vow and am free. As ordained by destiny the
stain of thy separation and thine abduction by that fickle-minded titan has been
expunged by me, a mortal. Of what use is great strength to the vacillating, who do
not with resolution avenge the insult offered to them?…
When Sita heard Rama speak in this wise, her large doe-like eyes filled with tears
and, beholding the beloved of his heart standing close to him, Rama, who was
apprehensive of public rumour, was torn within himself. Then, in the presence of the
monkeys and the titans, he said to Sita, whose eyes were as large as lotus petals, her
dark hair plaited, and who was endowed with faultless limbs:—
“What a man should do in order to wipe out an insult, I have done by slaying
Ravana for I guard mine honour jealously!… Be happy and let it be known that this
arduous campaign, so gloriously terminated through the support of my friends, was
not undertaken wholly for thy sake. I was careful to wipe out the affront paid to me
completely and to avenge the insult offered to mine illustrious House.
“A suspicion has arisen, however, with regard to thy conduct, and thy presence is
as painful to me as a lamp to one whose eye is diseased! Henceforth go where it best
pleaseth thee, I give thee leave, O Daughter of Janaka. O Lovely One, the ten regions
are at thy disposal; I can have nothing more to do with thee! What man of honour
would give rein to his passion so far as to permit himself to take back a woman who
has dwelt in the house of another? Thou hast been taken into Ravana’s lap and he

has cast lustful glances on thee; how can I reclaim thee, I who boast of belonging to
an illustrious House? The end which I sought in re-conquering thee has been gained;
I no longer have any attachment for thee; go where thou desirest!… Assuredly
Ravana, beholding thy ravishing and celestial beauty, will not have respected thy
person during the time that thou didst dwell in his abode.”
On this, that noble lady, worthy of being addressed in sweet words, hearing that
harsh speech from her beloved lord, who for long had surrounded her with every
homage, wept bitterly, and she resembled a creeper that has been torn away by the
trunk of a great elephant.
“Why dost thou address such words to me, O Hero, as a common man addresses
an ordinary woman? I swear to thee, O Long-armed Warrior, that my conduct is
worthy of thy respect! It is the behavior of other women that has filled thee with
distrust! Relinquish thy doubts since I am known to thee! If my limbs came in
contact with another’s, it was against my will, O Lord, and not through any
inclination on my part; it was brought about by fate. [Sita enters a burning pyre to
demonstrate her innocence.] Thereafter the Witness of the whole world, the god of
fire, addressed Rama, saying:—
“Here is Vaidehi, O Rama, there is no sin in her! Neither by word, feeling or
glance has thy lovely consort shown herself to be unworthy of thy noble qualities.
Separated from thee, that unfortunate one was borne away against her will in the
lonely forest by Ravana, who had grown proud on account of his power. Though
imprisoned and closely guarded by titan women in the inner apartments, thou wast
ever the focus of her thoughts and her supreme hope. Surrounded by hideous and
sinister women, though tempted and threatened, Maithili never gave place in her
heart to a single thought for that titan and was solely absorbed in thee. She is pure
and without taint, do thou receive Maithili; it is my command that she should not
suffer reproach in any way.”
These words filled Rama’s heart with delight and he, the most eloquent of men,
that loyal soul, reflected an instant within himself, his glance full of joy. Then the
illustrious, steadfast and exceedingly valiant Rama, the first of virtuous men, hearing
those words addressed to him, said to the Chief of the Gods:—
“On account of the people, it was imperative that Sita should pass through this
trial by fire; this lovely woman had dwelt in Ravana’s inner apartments for a long
time. Had I not put the innocence of Janaki to the test, the people would have said:
— ‘Rama, the son of Dasaratha is governed by lust!’ It was well known to me that
Sita had never given her heart to another and that [she], was ever devoted to me.…
That virtuous woman could never belong to any other than myself for she is to me
what the light is to the sun. [A later chapter was added, responding to the belief that
even innocent cohabitation with another man is unacceptable and detailing Rama’s
renewed exile of Sita and her death.]

CHAPTER 6
MILITARY ROLES IN CHINA AND ROME
The great empires that culminated in the Han dynasty in China and the Roman
Empire around the Mediterranean invite comparison in many ways. They both ruled
huge territories (not too dissimilar in total size) and populations (about 56 million
people at the height of Han China, about 54 million in the Roman Empire). They
created monuments and institutions long remembered, indeed long influential, and
they both ultimately declined, though at slightly different times and with markedly
different long-range outcomes. The Chinese Empire began to form earlier than its
Roman counterpart, and it defined elements that persist in China to the present day,
including core geography. The Roman achievement later became more fragmented.
Both empires, of course, depended greatly on military conquest and sustained
military organization. The great Roman legions formed one of the most famous and
effective fighting forces in world history, with rigorous training and comradeship
among the soldiers, under the leadership of powerful generals. Chinese generals
lacked the power of their Roman counterparts, for there was more bureaucratic
control. They too stressed discipline, but they also delved more deeply into issues of
strategy and even basic philosophy. Sun-Tzu, in the fifth century B.C.E. (under the
still-fragmented Zhou dynasty), wrote one of the great theoretical works of all time,
The Art of War, still widely studied and indeed revived by Mao Zedong and used to
promote doctrines of guerrilla warfare in the century.
The following documents come from very different stages of empire: Sun Tzu was
writing to promote better military organization when Chinese imperial unity had yet
fully to form. Vegetius wrote at the end of empire, intending to advise one of the
later Roman emperors (either Theodosius I or Valentian III) and to correct
contemporary failings in recruitment and training. Vegetius did borrow from earlier
writings, dating back to the Republican period, but his work may certainly have
been colored by the increasing problems Rome was facing with the Germanic
invasions.
Questions
1. How do Sun-Tzu and Vegetius approach the subject of military success? Do both
works suggest the reasons China and Rome achieved such great military power in
the classical period? Are the reasons entirely different in the two cases?
2. To what extent do the two works reflect very different stages in the imperial
process? Can Sun-Tzu be interpreted as an author writing before the full
development of empire, and Vegetius as an author writing when the empire is on
the defensive?
3. What do the two works imply about the importance of the military in the larger
society, in China and in Rome, respectively?
For Further Discussion
1. Is it valid to suggest that these two documents imply significant differences in the
military role in the Chinese and Roman empires, respectively? What else would
you need to know to deal with this question more fully?
2. Why has Sun-Tzu survived as a military treatise worth reading, and no
comparable Roman treatise exists?

SUN-TZU, THE ART OF WAR
This is probably one of the two most famous military books ever written. (The other
would be the much more modern work by Clausewitz, written in the 1820s.)

Better take
An army
A regiment,
A detachment,
A company,
Intact
Than destroy them.
Ultimate excellence lies
Not in winning
Every battle
But in defeating the enemy
Without ever fighting.
The highest form of warfare
Is to attack
Strategy itself; The next,
To attack
Alliances;
The next,
To attack
Armies
The lowest form of war is
To attack
Cities.
Siege warfare
Is a last resort.
In a siege,
Three months are needed
To assemble
Protective shields,
Armored wagons,

And sundry
Siege weapons and equipment;
Another three months
To pile
Earthen ramps.
The general who cannot
Master his anger
Orders his troops out
Like ants,
Sending one in three
To their deaths,
Without taking the city.
This is the calamity
Of siege warfare.
The Skillful Strategist
Defeats the enemy
Without doing battle,
Captures the city
Without laying siege,
Overthrows the enemy state
Without protracted war.
He strives for supremacy
Under heaven
Intact,

Split in half.
If equally matched,
Fight it out;
If fewer in number,
Lie low;

Numbers; Have officers and men who
Share a single will;
Be ready
For the unexpected; Have a capable general,
Unhampered by his sovereign.
These five
Point the way to
Victory.
Hence the saying
“Know the enemy,
Know yourself,

VEGETIUS, EPITOME OF MILITARY SCIENCE

Little is known about Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus. He was a Christian and a
prominent horse breeder who probably lived either in Spain or in France (Gaul) and
served a high position in the Roman imperial bureaucracy. He also wrote a book on
curing diseases in mules.
•••
(1.3) Whether recruits from the country or from the city are more useful.
The next question is to consider whether a recruit from the country or from the city
is more useful. On this subject, I think it could never have been doubted that the
rural populace is better suited for arms. They are nurtured under the open sky in a
life of work, enduring the sun, careless of shade, unacquainted with bathhouses,
ignorant of luxury, simple-souled, content with a little, with limbs toughened to
endure every kind of toil, and for whom wielding iron, digging a fosse, and carrying
a burden is what they are used to from the country.…
(1.6) That the potentially better recruits are recognized at selection from the face
and physical posture.
He who is charged with carrying out the levy procedure should take great pains to
choose those able to fill the part of soldiers from the face, from the eyes, from the
whole conformation of the limbs. For quality is indicated not only in men, but even
in horses and dogs, by many points. … So let the adolescent who is to be selected for
material activity have alert eyes, straight neck, broad chest, muscular shoulders,
strong arms, long fingers; let him be small in the stomach, slender in the buttocks,
and have calves and feet that are not swollen by surplus fat, but firm with hard
muscle. When you see these points in a recruit, you need not greatly regret the
absence of tall stature. It is more useful that soldiers be strong than big.
From N. P. Milner, Vegetius: Epitome of Military Science (2nd ed., Liverpool, 1996),
4–13. Used by permission of Liverpool University Press.
(1.8) When recruits should be marked.
The recruit should not be tattooed with the pin-pricks of the official mark as soon as
he has been selected, but first be thoroughly tested in exercises so that it may be
established whether he is truly fitted for so much effort. Both mobility and strength
are thought to be required of him, and whether he is able to learn the discipline of
arms, whether he has the self-confidence of a soldier. For very many, though they
seem not unacceptable in appearance, are yet found unsuitable in training.
Therefore, the less useful ones should be rejected, and in their place the most
energetic should be substituted. For in any conflict it is not so much numbers as
bravery that pays off. So once the recruits have been tattooed, the science of arms
should be shown them in daily training.…
(1.9) Recruits should be trained in the military step, in running, and in jumping.
So, at the very start of the training, recruits should be taught the military step. For
nothing should be maintained more on the march or in battle than that all soldiers
should keep ranks as they move. The only way that this can be done is by learning
through constant training to maneuver quickly and evenly. For a divided and
disordered army experiences danger from the enemy which is always most serious.
So at the military step, twenty miles should be covered in five hours, at least in
summer time. At the full step, which is faster, twenty-four miles should be covered
in the same time. If you add anything to this, it now becomes running, for which a
distance cannot be defined. … The soldier should also be trained at jumping,

whereby ditches are vaulted, and hurdles of a certain height surmounted, so that
when obstacles of this kind are encountered, he can cross them without effort.
Furthermore, in actual conflict and clash of arms, the soldier coming on by a
running jump makes the adversary’s eyes flinch, frightens his mind, and plants a
blow before the other can properly prepare himself.…
(1.10) Recruits should be trained in the art of swimming Every recruit without
exception should, in the summer months, learn the art of swimming, for rivers are
not always crossed by bridges, and armies both when advancing and retreating are
frequently forced to swim. Torrents often tend to flood after sudden falls of rain or
snow, and ignorance of swimming incurs risk not only from the enemy but the water
also. Therefore, the ancient Romans, who were trained in the whole art of warfare
through so many wars and continual crises, selected the Campus Martius next to the
Tiber in which the youth might wash off sweat and dust after training in arms, and
lose their fatigue from running by the exercise of swimming.…
(1.11) How the ancients trained recruits with wicker shields and with posts.
The ancients, as one finds in books, trained recruits in this manner. They wove
shields from withies, of hurdle-like construction, and circular, such that the hurcle
had twice the weight that a government shield normally has. They also gave recruits
wooden foils, likewise of double weight, instead of swords. So equipped, they were
trained not only in the morning but even after noon against posts. Indeed, the use of
posts is of very great benefit to gladiators as well as soldiers. Neither the arena nor
the [practice]-field ever proved a man invincible in armed combat, unless he was
judged to have been thoroughly trained at the post. Each recruit would plant a
single post in the ground so that it could not move, and protruded six feet. Against
the post, as if against an adversary, the recruit trained himself using the foil and
hurdle like a sword and shield, so that now he aimed at, as it were, the head and
face, now threatened the flanks, then tried to cut the ham-strings and legs, backed
off, came on, sprang, and aimed at the post with every method of attack and art of
combat, as though it were an actual opponent. In this traning, care was taken that
the recruit drew himself up to inflict wounds without exposing any part of himself
to a blow.
(1.19) Recruits should be trained in carrying a burden.
Recruits should very frequently be made to carry a burden of up to sixty pounds,
and route-march at the military step, since on arduous campaigns they have
necessarily to carry their rations together with their ams. This should not be thought
hard, once the habit has been gained, for there is nothing that continual practice
does not render very easy. We know that the ancient soldiers used to do this exercise
from the evidence of Vergil himself, who says: “Just as the bold Roman in his
national arms cruelly laden takes the road, and before the enemy expects it, stands
in formation, having pitched camp.”

CHAPTER 7
BUDDHISM AND CHRISTIANITY
The origin and early development of two of the great world religions lie in the
classical period. Both Buddhism and Christianity arose where important religious
developments had already occurred, but partially in protest against established
formulas. Both sought to dispense with what their leaders viewed as excessive
ceremonies and religious officialdom, in favor of a focus on spiritual values. Both,
unquestionably, spurred new interest in otherworldly goals.
Buddhism originated in India, with Prince Gautama (563–483 B.C.E.), who later
took the name “Buddha,” or “Enlightened One.” Protesting key features of Hinduism,
including the great role of priests and ritual and the caste system, Buddhism
maintained and extended Hindu disdain for earthly life, looking to an ultimate
union with the divine essence, which the new religion called nirvana. Buddha
transmitted his thoughts to disciples orally, and they were only gradually written
down. From a small movement concentrated around its holy founder, Buddhism
spread widely in India during the classical period, rivaling but also coexisting with
Hinduism. By the end of the classical period, Buddhism was shrinking in India itself,
as Hinduism consolidated its majority hold. But it was gaining new converts in Sri
Lanka, in other parts of southeastern Asia, and in China.
Christianity originated later, in the other great center of religious origins in world
history, the Middle East. Inspired by Jesus Christ, who was crucified in 30 C.E.,
Christianity developed quickly as various disciples and early converts spelled out
their story of Jesus’ life and doctrines and began to form religious communities. For
a brief time, Christian leaders emphasized reform within the Jewish religion, but
soon other converts were sought as the religion linked to the wider Greco-Roman
world. By 300 C.E. probably about 10 percent of all the people in the empire were
Christian, drawn to the message of hope for the poor and an intellectual and
spiritual structure that added important elements to existing Greco-Roman culture.
A strong church organization, with religious officials such as priests and bishops,
arose in many regions, paralleling the organization of the empire itself.
Christianity and Buddhism shared many features, which helps explain their
similar success in converting masses of people in various regions and of various
cultural backgrounds. They both offered hope for religious advancement, mainly
after this life but to a limited extent during it. They both expressed suspicion of
worldly things and offered an ethic designed to help religious people avoid giving in
to snares and temptations. Both, not surprisingly, sponsored monastic movements
where small groups of people could seek holiness apart from normal worldly cares.
The two religions also differed greatly. Their attitude toward the world and its
doings diverged; a careful comparison might begin by trying to define this
difference. Buddhists emphasized miseries, whereas Christian leaders such as Paul
stressed sin. How would Christian and Buddhist attitudes toward government or
human achievement compare? A second difference lies in the teachings about how
to deal with misery or sin: what is the good religious life, and how much control
does an individual have over it? Buddhists and Christians differed greatly in their
views on how to lead a holy life and also on the intervention of divine forces. This
difference relates to the strong organizational contrast between the two religions,

with Christianity being far more focused on church institutions as the embodiment
of faith.
Questions
1. What aspects of Christianity and Buddhism—whether similar or different—help
explain their great appeal?
2. How did Buddhist and Christian leaders define the main goals of life? What are
the concepts of nirvana and Christian salvation? How did the two religions view
the human body and its needs?
3. How did Buddhist and Christian leaders define divinity? What were the roles of
Buddha and of Christ in religious life?
4. In what respects did Buddhist and Christian leaders agree, and in what respects
did they disagree, about how to lead a holy life? How would the two religions
view the state? How would they view acts of charity in relation to a holy life?
5. Why did Buddhism develop less of a formal church structure than Christianity?
Does the difference relate to differences in the ideals of the two religions? How
would the two religions, as they matured, approach problems of truth and error?
What was the Christian approach, by the fourth century, to what it called heresy?
Which religion would be more tolerant, and why?
For Further Discussion
1. How did Buddhism and Christianity reflect the earlier traditions of their cultures
—Hinduism and the Indian epics, for Buddhism; Greek philosophy and Roman
law, for Christianity?
2. How did Buddhism resemble Hinduism? How did it differ?
3. How would Buddhist monasticism compare with Christian, in institutions devoted
to the holiest possible life?
4. Why did Christianity and Buddhism both have such wide appeal during the late
classical centuries and beyond? How did the spread of both religions relate to the
decline of Classical Chinese and Roman Civilizations?
BUDDHISM
The first Buddhist selection below, entitled “The Four Noble Truths,” lies at the core
of Buddha’s quest for understanding after he had renounced worldly things. It
suggests a central definition of Buddhist goals. The second passage, which more
explicitly explains what an individual should do to live a holy life, comes from the
Dhammapada, or Footsteps of the Law. This was probably written down toward the
end of the period, when Buddhist doctrines had been fully established, at about 70
B.C.E. Later Buddhism also reflected some belief in the holiness of Buddha himself,
which had not been part of Gautama’s original vision but which helped spread the
religion as people sought to attach their otherworldly aspirations to the merits of
saintly leaders.

THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS
1. The Truth Concerning Misery

And how, O priests, does a priest live, as respects the elements of being, observant of
the elements of being in the four noble truths?

Whenever, O priest, a priest knows the truth concerning misery, knows the truth
concerning the origin of misery, knows the truth concerning the cessation of misery,
knows the truth concerning the path leading to the cessation of misery.
And what, O priests, is the noble truth of misery?
Birth is misery; old age is misery; disease is misery; death is misery; sorrow,
lamentation, misery, grief, and despair are misery; to wish for what one cannot have
is misery; in short, all the five attachment-groups are misery.
This, O priests, is called the noble truth of misery.
From Henry Clarke Warren, Buddhism in Translations: Passages Selected from the
Buddhist Sacred Books and Translated from the Original Pali into English, Student’s
Edition Harvard Oriental Series. (Cam-bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press,

Reprinted by permission of the publisher.
2. The Truth of the Origin of Misery

And what, O priests, is the noble truth of the origin of misery?
It is desire leading to rebirth, joining itself to pleasure and passion, and finding
delight in every existence,—desire, namely, for sensual pleasure, desire for
permanent existence, desire for transitory existence.
But where, O priests, does this desire spring up and grow? where does it settle and
take root?
Where anything is delightful and agreeable to men, there desire springs up and
grows, there it settles and takes root.
And what is delightful and agreeable to men, where desire springs up and grows,
where it settles and takes root?
The eye is delightful and agreeable to men; there desire springs up and grows,
there it settles and takes root.
The ear… the nose… the tongue… the body… the mind is delightful and
agreeable to men; there desire springs up and grows, there it settles and takes root.
The Six Organs of Sense.
Forms… sounds… odors… tastes… things tangible… ideas are delightful and
agreeable to men; there desire springs up and grows, there it settles and takes root.
The Six Objects of Sense.
Eye-consciousness … ear-consciousness … nose-consciousness … tongueconsciousness… body-consciousness… mind-consciousness is delightful and
agreeable to men; there desire springs up and grows, there it settles and takes root.…
The Six Sensations.
Perception of forms… sounds… odors… tastes… things tangible… ideas is
delightful and agreeable to men; there desire springs up and grows, there it settles
and takes root.…
The Six Reasonings.
Reflection on forms… sounds… odors… tastes… things tangible… ideas is
delightful and agreeable to men; there desire springs up and grows, there it settles
and takes root.
The Six Reflections.

This, O priests, is called the noble truth of the origin of misery.
3. The Truth of the Cessation of Misery

And what, O priests, is the noble truth of the cessation of misery?
It is the complete fading out and cessation of this desire, a giving up, a losing
hold, a relinquishment, and a nonadhesion.
But where, O priests, does this desire wane and disappear? where is it broken up
and destroyed?
Where anything is delightful and agreeable to men; there desire wanes and
disappears, there it is broken up and destroyed.
And what is delightful and agreeable to men, where desire wanes and disappears,
where it is broken up and destroyed?
The eye is delightful and agreeable to men; there desire wanes and disappears,
there it is broken up and destroyed.…
This, O priests, is called the noble truth of the cessation of misery.
4. The Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Misery

And what, O priests, is the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of
misery?
It is this noble eightfold path, to wit, right belief, right resolve, right speech, right
behavior, right occupation, …, right contemplation, right concentration.
And what, O priests, is right belief?
The knowledge of misery, O priests, the knowledge of the origin of misery, the
knowledge of the cessation of misery, and the knowledge of the path leading to the
cessation of misery, this, O priests, is called “right belief.”
And what, O priests, is right resolve?
The resolve to renounce sensual pleasures, the resolve to have malice towards
none, and the resolve to harm no living creature, this, O priests, is called “right
resolve.”
And what, O priests, is right speech?
To abstain from falsehood, to abstain from backbiting, to abstain from harsh
language, and to abstain from frivolous talk, this, O priests, is called “right speech.”
And what, O priests, is right behavior?
To abstain from destroying life, to abstain from taking that which is not given
one, and to abstain from immorality, this, O priests, is called “right behavior.”
And what, O priests, is right occupation?
Whenever, O priests, a noble disciple, quitting a wrong occupation, gets his
livelihood by a right occupation, this, O priests, is called “right occupation.”…
And what, O priests, is right contemplation?
Whenever, O priests, a priest lives, as respects the body, observant of the body,
strenuous, conscious, contemplative, and has rid himself of lust and grief; as respects
sensations, observant of sensations, strenuous, conscious, contemplative, and has rid
himself of lust and grief; as respects the mind, observant of the mind, strenuous,
conscious, contemplative, and has rid himself of lust and grief; as respects the
elements of being, observant of the elements of being, strenuous, conscious,

contemplative, and has rid himself of lust and grief, this, O priests, is called “right
contemplation.”
And what, O priests, is right concentration?
Whenever, O priests, a priest, having isolated himself from sensual pleasures,
having isolated himself from demeritorious traits, and still exercising reasoning, still
exercising reflection, enters upon the first trance which is produced by isolation and
characterized by joy and happiness; when, through the subsidence of reasoning and
reflection, and still retaining joy and happiness, he enters upon the second trance,
which is an interior tranquilization and intentness of the thoughts, and is produced
by concentration; when, through the paling of joy, indifferent, contemplative,
conscious, and in the experience of bodily happiness—that state which eminent men
describe when they say, “Indifferent, contemplative, and living happily”—he enters
upon the third trance; when, through the abandonment of happiness, through the
abandonment of misery, through the disappearance of all antecedent gladness and
grief, he enters upon the fourth trance, which has neither misery nor happiness, but
is contemplation as refined by indifference, this, O priests, is called “right
concentration.”
This, O priests, is called the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of
misery.
THE WAY, FROM THE DHAMMAPADA

The best of ways is the eightfold; the best of truths the four words; the best of
virtues passionlessness; the best of men he who has eyes to see.
This is the way, there is no other that leads to the purifying of intelligence. Go on
this path! This is the confusion of Mâra, the tempter.
If you go on this way, you will make an end of pain! The way preached by me,
when I had understood the removal of the thorns in the flesh.
You yourself must make an effort. The Tathâgatas (Buddhas) are only preachers.
The thoughtful who enter the way are freed from the bondage of Mâra.
“All created things perish,” he who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain;
this is the way to purity.
“All created things are grief and pain,” he who knows and sees this becomes
passive in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.
“All forms are unreal,” he who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain; this
is the way that leads to purity.
He who does not rouse himself when it is time to rise, who, though young and
strong, is full of sloth, whose will and thought are weak, that lazy and idle man
never finds the way to knowledge.
Watching his speech, well restrained in mind, let a man never commit any wrong
with his body! Let a man but keep these three roads of action clear, and he will
achieve the way which is taught by the wise.
Through zeal knowledge is gained, through lack of zeal knowledge is lost; let a
man who knows this double path of gain and loss thus place himself that knowledge
may grow.
From The Sacred Books of the East, trans. Epiphanus Wilson (New York: Colonial
Press, 1900), 138–39.

Cut down the whole forest of desires, not a tree only! Danger comes out of the
forest of desires. When you have cut down both the forest of desires and its
undergrowth, then… you will be rid of the forest and of desires!
So long as the desire of man towards women, even the smallest, is not destroyed,
so long is his mind in bondage, as the calf that drinks milk is to its mother.
Cut out the love of self, like an autumn lotus, with thy hand! Cherish the road of
peace. Nirvâna has been shown by Sugata (Buddha).
“Here I shall dwell in the rain, here in winter and summer,” thus the fool
meditates, and does not think of death.
Death comes and carries off that man, honored for his children and flocks, his
mind distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.
Sons are no help, nor a father, nor relations; there is no help from kinsfolk for one
whom death has seized.
A wise and well-behaved man who knows the meaning of this should quickly
clear the way that leads to Nirvâna.
CHRISTIANITY
The two Christian passages below come from different stages of the religion’s
development. Paul’s Letter to the Romans was written at the height of his career as
Christian missionary and formulator of doctrine, between 54 and 58 C.E. It became
part of the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The letter reflects an effort to
appeal to all peoples with the message of Christian truth, Christ’s redemption from
sin, and potential salvation. The second document was written by a monk, Vincent
of Lerins, in 434, as Christianity became established and began to deal
systematically with quarrels over doctrine. Vincent grappled with the problem of
knowing religious truth from falsehood, in a work that became known as the
Vincentian Canon. His approach obviously reflected the role the institutional church
had gained in defining Christian beliefs.

LETTER FROM PAUL TO THE ROMANS

So sin must no longer reign in your mortal body, exacting obedience to the body’s
desires. You must no longer put its several parts at sin’s disposal, as implements for
doing wrong. No: put yourselves at the disposal of God, as dead men raised to life;
yield your bodies to him as implements for doing right; for sin shall no longer be
your master, because you are no longer under law, but under the grace of God.
From The New English Bible (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1922), 182–85,
189–91. Copyright © Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press 1961,
1970. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.
What then? Are we to sin, because we are not under law but under grace? Of
course not. You know well enough that if you put yourselves at the disposal of a
master, to obey him, you are slaves of the master whom you obey; and this is true
whether you serve sin, with death as its result; or obedience, with righteousness as
its result. But God be thanked, you, who once were slaves of sin, have yielded
wholehearted obedience to the pattern of teaching to which you were made subject,
and, emancipated from sin, have become slaves of righteousness (to use words that
suit your human weakness)—I mean, as you once yielded your bodies to the service

of impurity and lawlessness, making for moral anarchy, so now you must yield them
to the service of righteousness, making for a holy life.
When you were slaves of sin, you were free from the control of righteousness; and
what was the gain? Nothing but what now makes you ashamed, for the end of that
is death. But now, freed from the commands of sin, and bound to the service of God,
your gains are such as make for holiness, and the end is eternal life. For sin pays a
wage, and the wage is death, but God gives freely, and his gift is eternal life, in
union with Christ Jesus our Lord.
You cannot be unaware, my friends—I am speaking to those who have some
knowledge of law—that a person is subject to the law so long as he is alive, and no
longer. … So you, my friends, have died to the law by becoming identified with the
body of Christ, and accordingly you have found another husband in him who rose
from the dead, so that we may bear fruit for God. While we lived on the level of our
lower nature, the sinful passions evoked by the law worked in our bodies, to bear
fruit for death. But now, having died to that which held us bound, we are discharged
from the law, to serve God in a new way, the way of the spirit, in contrast to the old
way, the way of a written code.
What follows? Is the law identical with sin? Of course not. But except through
law I should never have become acquainted with sin. For example, I should never
have known what it was to covet, if the law had not said, ‘Thou shalt not covet.’
Through that commandment sin found its opportunity, and produced in me all kinds
of wrong desires. In the absence of law, sin is a dead thing. There was a time when,
in the absence of law, I was fully alive; but when the commandment came, sin
sprang to life and I died. The commandment which should have led to life proved in
my experience to lead to death, because sin found its opportunity in the
commandment, seduced me, and through the commandment killed me.
Therefore the law is in itself holy, and the commandment is holy and just and
good. Are we to say then that this good thing was the death of me? By no means. It
was sin that killed me, and thereby sin exposed its true character: it used a good
thing to bring about my death, and so, through the commandment, sin became more
sinful than ever.
We know that the law is spiritual; but I am not: I am unspiritual, the purchased
slave of sin. I do not even acknowledge my own actions as mine, for what I do is not
what I want to do, but what I detest. But if what I do is against my will, it means
that I agree with the law and hold it to be admirable. But as things are, it is no
longer I who perform the action, but sin that lodges in me. For I know that nothing
good lodges in me—in my unspiritual nature, I mean—for though the will to do
good is there, the deed is not. The good which I want to do, I fail to do; but what I
do is the wrong which is against my will; and if what I do is against my will, clearly
it is no longer I who am the agent, but sin that has its lodging in me.
I discover this principle, then: that when I want to do the right, only the wrong is
within my reach. In my inmost self I delight in the law of God, but I perceive that
there is in my bodily members a different law, fighting against the law that my
reason approves and making me a prisoner under the law that is in my members, the
law of sin. Miserable creature that I am, who is there to rescue me out of this body
doomed to death? God alone, through Jesus Christ our Lord! Thanks be to God! In a
word then, I myself, subject to God’s law as a rational being, am yet, in my
unspiritual nature, a slave to the law of sin.
The conclusion of the matter is this: there is no condemnation for those who are

united with Christ Jesus, because in Christ Jesus the life-giving law of the Spirit has
set you free from the law of sin and death. What the law could never do, because
our lower nature robbed it of all potency, God has done: by sending his own Son in
a form like that of our own sinful nature, and as a sacrifice for sin, he has passed
judgement against sin within that very nature, so that the commandment of the law
may find fulfilment in us, whose conduct, no longer under the control of our lower
nature, is directed by the Spirit.
Those who live on the level of our lower nature have their outlook formed by it,
and that spells death; but those who live on the level of the spirit have the spiritual
outlook, and that is life and peace. For the outlook of the lower nature is enmity
with God; it is not subject to the law of God; indeed it cannot be: those who live on
such a level cannot possibly please God.
But that is not how you live. You are on the spiritual level, if only God’s Spirit
dwells within you; and if a man does not possess the Spirit of Christ, he is no
Christian. But if Christ is dwelling within you, then although the body is a dead
thing because you sinned, yet the spirit is life itself because you have been justified.
Moreover, if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells within you,
then the God who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give new life to your
mortal bodies through his indwelling Spirit.
It follows, my friends, that our lower nature has no claim upon us; we are not
obliged to live on that level. If you do so, you must die. But if by the Spirit you put
to death all the base pursuits of the body, then you will live.
For all who are moved by the Spirit of God are sons of God. The Spirit you have
received is not a spirit of slavery leading you back into a life of fear, but a Spirit
that makes us sons, enabling us to cry ‘Abba! Father!’ In that cry the Spirit of God
joins with our spirit in testifying that we are God’s children; and if children, then
heirs. We are God’s heirs and Christ’s fellow-heirs, if we share his sufferings now in
order to share his splendour hereafter.
For I reckon that the sufferings we now endure bear no comparison with the
splendour, as yet unrevealed, which is in store for us.…
Therefore, my brothers, I implore you by God’s mercy to offer your very selves to
him: a living sacrifice, dedicated and fit for his acceptance, the worship offered by
mind and heart. Adapt yourselves no longer to the pattern of this present world, but
let your minds be remade and your whole nature thus transformed. Then you will be
able to discern the will of God, and to know what is good, acceptable, and perfect.…
The gifts we possess differ as they are allotted to us by God’s grace, and must be
exercised accordingly: the gift of inspired utterance, for example, in proportion to a
man’s faith; or the gift of administration, in administration. A teacher should
employ his gift in teaching, and one who has the gift of stirring speech should use it
to stir his hearers. If you give to charity, give with all your heart; if you are a leader,
exert yourself to lead; if you are helping others in distress, do it cheerfully.…
Never pay back evil for evil. Let your aims be such as all men count honourable.
If possible, so far as it lies with you, live at peace with all men. My dear friends, do
not seek revenge, but leave a place for divine retribution; for there is a text which
reads, ‘Justice is mine, says the Lord, I will repay.’ But there is another text: ‘If your
enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; by doing this you will
heap live coals on his head.’ Do not let evil conquer you, but use good to defeat evil.
Every person must submit to the supreme authorities. There is no authority but by

act of God, and the existing authorities are instituted by him; consequently anyone
who rebels against authority is resisting a divine institution, and those who so resist
have themselves to thank for the punishment they will receive. For government, a
terror to crime, has no terrors for good behaviour. You wish to have no fear of the
authorities? Then continue to do right and you will have their approval, for they are
God’s agents working for your good. But if you are doing wrong, then you will have
cause to fear them; it is not for nothing that they hold the power of the sword, for
they are God’s agents of punishment, for retribution on the offender. That is why
you are obliged to submit. It is an obligation imposed not merely by fear of
retribution but by conscience. That is also why you pay taxes. The authorities are in
God’s service and to these duties they devote their energies.
Discharge your obligations to all men; pay tax and toll, reverence and respect, to
those to whom they are due. Leave no claim outstanding against you, except that of
mutual love. He who loves his neighbour has satisfied every claim of the law. For
the commandments, ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt
not steal, thou shalt not covet’, and any other commandment there may be, are all
summed up in the one rule, ‘Love your neighbour as yourself.’ Love cannot wrong a
neighbour; therefore the whole law is summed up in love.…
VINCENT OF LERINS

I have therefore continually given the greatest pains and diligence to enquiring, from
the greatest possible number of men outstanding in holiness and in doctrine, how I
can secure a kind of fixed and, as it were, general and guiding principle for
distinguishing the true Catholic Faith from the degraded falsehoods of heresy. And
the answer that I receive is always to this effect; that if I wish, or indeed if any one
wishes, to detect the deceits of heretics that arise and to avoid their snares and to
keep healthy and sound in a healthy faith, we ought, with the Lord’s help, to fortify
our faith in a twofold manner, firstly, that is, by the authority of God’s Law, then by
the tradition of the Catholic Church.
(2) Here, it may be, some one will ask, Since the canon of Scripture is complete,
and is in itself abundantly sufficient, what need is there to join to it the
interpretation of the Church? The answer is that because of the very depth of
Scripture all men do not place one identical interpretation upon it. The statements
of the same writer are explained by different men in different ways, so much so that
it seems almost possible to extract from it as many opinions as there are men.…
… Therefore, because of the intricacies of error, which is so multiform, there is
great need for the laying down of a rule for the exposition of Prophets and Apostles
in accordance with the standard of the interpretation of the Church Catholic.
(3) Now in the Catholic Church itself we take the greatest care to hold THAT WHICH
HAS BEEN BELIEVED EVERYWHERE, ALWAYS, AND BY ALL.
That is truly and properly ‘Catholic,’ as is shown by the very force and meaning of
the word, which comprehends everything almost universally. We shall hold to this
rule if we follow universality [i.e. œcumenicity], antiquity, and consent. We shall
follow universality if we acknowledge that one Faith to be true which the whole
Church throughout the world confesses; antiquity, if we in no wise depart from those
interpretations which it is clear that our ancestors and fathers proclaimed; consent,
if in antiquity itself we keep following the definitions and opinions of all, or
certainly nearly all, bishops and doctors alike.

PART II

The Postclassical Period, 450–1450
A MAJOR PHASE OF world history opened with the decline or collapse of the great

empires of Rome, Han China, and Gupta India by the fifth and sixth centuries C.E.
New forces were set in motion that persisted until the thirteenth century, followed
by a two-century transition lasting until about 1450.
During the classical period, the key developments in world history had been the
construction of large regional civilizations and their integration. This theme did not
disappear. Chinese history, for example, resumed many of its earlier patterns after
three centuries of real confusion. Indian civilization retained its basic integrity also,
though without the capacity to generate large, internally directed empires. The
Mediterranean was hopelessly divided, however, with Greco-Roman traditions
persisting only in the Byzantine Empire in the northeastern corner of the region. This
empire combined the use of the Greek language and culture with Roman imperial
institutions, Orthodox Christianity, and a lively trade. But overall, the formation of
empires loomed less large in this new period; other, looser political structures were
emphasized.
Several new trends emerged. First, major world religions, defined in terms of their
ability to convert peoples in various civilization areas, began to gain a greater hold.
The collapse of the classical empires prompted many people to turn to more
otherworldly goals; in some cases, such as Western Europe, the new religions also
provided the clearest shared beliefs and even institutional structures. Buddhism was
not new, but during this period it spread far more widely in eastern and
southeastern Asia. Christianity had already gained strength in the Mediterranean and
in a few parts of the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. Now it spread vigorously
northward, in two main strands (Catholic and Orthodox), ultimately reaching
Scandinavia in the west and Russia in the east. The third religion was new and by far
the most dynamic of all. Islam arose in the Middle East early in the seventh century.
It spread rapidly with Arab conquests in the Middle East and North Africa, where a
new government, the Caliphate, controlled vast territories. Islam also soon won
massive conversions in Central Asia, India (as a minority religion), parts of subSaharan Africa, Spain, and Southeast Asia.
The sheer spread of civilization was the second major development of the
postclassical period, in some cases related to the impact of Arab influence or the
consequences of the various missionary religions. Although the most sophisticated
cities and trade still were in the Middle East and North Africa, the Byzantine Empire,
India, and China, civilization also developed in additional parts of sub-Saharan
Africa (particularly a series of great kingdoms in present-day West Africa, known as
the Sudanic kingdoms); in Western Europe, under the influence of Catholic
Christianity; in Japan; in Southeast Asia; and in Russia and Eastern Europe. These
new civilization areas traded with the leading centers and were able to imitate
important aspects of culture (often including writing itself) and some political
forms. Finally, though quite separately, larger civilization zones spread in Central
America, culminating in the great Aztec Empire, and in the Andes region, with the
Inca Empire taking shape toward the end of the post-classical period.
By 1000 C.E. the major societies of Afro-Eurasia were in regular contact. Here was
the third main theme of the postclassical centuries. Trade levels, cultural exchanges,
and some military clashes created a new regional network. Inventions developed in

one center, such as China’s introduction of paper, began to spread more rapidly to
other areas. Not only religious ideas but also some artistic forms began to affect
numerous different civilizations. Heightened international contact also sped the
dissemination of diseases, for example, the great bubonic plague (Black Death) of
the fourteenth century, which began in China and within decades reached both the
Arab world and Europe, with deadly effects. An increasingly important component
of world history involves understanding the different reactions by the major
civilizations to their wider contacts. Muslim traders organized the interregional
network during much of the period, but Mongol conquests and, briefly, Chinese
initiative played major roles in the final postclassical centuries.
Two kinds of comparison focus attention on the major developments of the
postclassical period: comparison of separate patterns and comparison of reactions to
common forces.
First, the distinct characteristics of individual civilizations continue to command
attention. Particular world religions provided new contrasts among regions. Thus,
the impacts of religion on government forms created some common themes but also
some new differentiation between the Middle East and Christian Europe. Conditions
of women were affected by the different cultures of Islam and the major strands of
Christianity, whereas China, less affected by new cultural influences, displayed more
continuity. Comparison is vital to determine the characteristics of the new
civilization centers and their relationship to the older civilizations.
The second type of comparison is possible because of the intensification of
interactions among civilizations in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Still distinctive, many
civilizations had to respond to common influences and events. Increasing interaction
thus organizes a new set of comparative issues, which had not existed in the
previous world history periods: comparison around a common development or
contact. Europeans and Muslims encountered each other in Christian crusades to
conquer the Holy Land. These conflicts provided important new influences on
Europe but also allow analysis of differences and hostilities between the two
societies that were sharpened by contact. Merchant activity increased in the
postclassical centuries, through both internal and external trade. Despite new
commercial contacts, different societies maintained different ideas about merchants
and their contributions. Near the end of the period, the Mongol conquests in China,
Russia, and elsewhere created new channels of international exchange—but again,
reactions to this episode varied, showing how civilizations could change as a result
of common impacts but retain their distinctive patterns.

CHAPTER 8
RELIGION AND STATE IN ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY
Relationship with secular government is a problem for any religion and its leaders
(and vice versa). Governments normally concentrate at least in part on issues of war
and earthly justice, and perhaps some economic issues such as provisioning cities or
helping the poor. What connection do these functions and the people responsible for
them have with the purposes of life as defined by religion? What if a government
does not attend properly to religion or even is hostile to it? Or, from a government
standpoint, what if religious officials seem to be falling down on the job or
interfering with obviously secular concerns? The Chinese government ultimately
turned against Buddhism in the ninth century, because it felt it must protect the
primacy of loyalties to the state. Issues of this sort were different from leading
political ideals in the classical period, when except in India religion was less
prominent. One change was clear: no Christian or Muslim ruler could claim he was
god, unlike some Romans and as opposed to the Chinese Son of Heaven concept.
Early on Christian leaders had faced the issue of what to do about the state. As he
tried to spread the new religion to a wide audience, Paul stressed the importance of
obeying government authorities even though the chief interests of the good Christian
centered on divine power (see chapter 6). As the Christian church developed in
Western Europe, with officials and institutions independent of the state, questions of
mutual relations became more pressing. The adoption of Christianity by the Roman
Empire, and then later by governments in Western Europe, complicated the issue still
further: Christian political leaders thought they had a religious role to play (and
might want to use religion to bolster their power); church leaders might welcome
political support but would often fear secular control.
The rapid rise of Islam, following Muhammad’s formulation of the religion early
in the seventh century, raised broadly similar concerns. Here was another religion
devoted to the power and glory of God; purely political purposes would pale by
comparison. Yet, even more than Christianity, Islam developed a highly legalistic
impulse. The Koran, which Muhammad presented as the word of Allah, contained a
host of rules for family and business behavior. Further religious codes developed,
particularly in the Hadith. But if religion regulated so many aspects of human
affairs, was there a separate place for government? The situation was further
complicated by the fact that although Islam had religious officials—including
scholars who interpreted Muslim law—there was no institutional church of the sort
that developed in Western Europe, with a clear leadership hierarchy. And
Muhammad, like Paul, had explicitly urged the faithful to obey even a bad ruler—
religious people should not be distracted by political concerns.
The following passages present some of the Christian and Muslim views as they
took shape in the postclassical period, and suggest on balance that they are different.
The differences reflected variations in the two religions, but they also had huge
implications concerning the power of the state—at the time and subsequently.
Questions
1. What were the main differences in the ways Christian and Muslim thinkers defined
the state in its relationship to religion? What state functions would both religions
agree on? How does the existence of a separate church differentiate the Christian

from the Muslim approach?
2. Might Muslims disagree about the state’s relation to religion in ways at all similar
to the postclassical Christian debate? Did Islam impose any limits on a good ruler?
3. What would a Muslim think of the Christian debate about papal versus imperial
power?
4. In the final analysis, are there major differences between Christian and Muslim
definitions of a good ruler? Do the religions differ in their beliefs about what to
do if a ruler is bad?
For Further Discussion
1. Why did both Christian and Muslim leaders urge obedience to the state in almost
all circumstances?
2. Which approach, the Christian or the Muslim, would produce more responsible
government?
3. Are differences between Christian and Muslim political traditions—complex as
both traditions were—still visible in the world today? Do you agree that Christian
ideas help explain a limited state concept in the West? What state concept most
logically follows from Muslim ideals?
A MUSLIM VIEW: NIZAM AL-MULK
Nizam al-Mulk was a Persian bureaucrat who served sultans for the Seljuk Turks for
thirty years during the eleventh century, at a time when the Seljuks controlled much
of the Middle East (it was the Seljuks who a bit later opposed the Christians in the
Crusades). This treatise in some ways resembles a host of works throughout history
that were designed to please kings. King-pleaser treatises flattered rulers by telling
them how to get and keep power and generally insisting on their importance to their
people. But this was a Muslim statement, and religion is very much present in the
kinds of responsibilities and restraints Nizam al-Mulk insists upon in the name of
God. The document refers to the title caliph, taken by the prophet Muhammad’s
Arab successors, who claimed wide religious powers and duties. It frequently invokes
the holy book the Quran (Koran).
•••
1. In every age and time God (be He exalted) chooses one member of the human
race and, having adorned and endowed him with kingly virtues, entrusts him with
the interests of the world and the well-being of His servants; He charges that person
to close the doors of corruption, confusion and discord, and He imparts to him such
dignity and majesty in the eyes and hearts of men, that under his just rule they may
live their lives in constant security and ever wish for his reign to continue.
2. Whenever—Allah be our refuge!—there occurs any disobedience or disregard of
divine laws on the part of His servants, or any failure in devotion and attention to
the commands of The Truth (be He exalted), and He wishes to chasten them and
make them taste the retribution for their deeds—may God not deal us such a fate,
and keep us far from such a calamity!—verily the wrath of The Truth overtakes
those people and He forsakes them for the vileness of their disobedience; anarchy
rears its head in their midst, opposing swords are drawn, [and] blood is shed.…
3. Then by divine decree one human being acquires some prosperity and power,
and according to his deserts The Truth bestows good fortune upon him and gives
him wit and wisdom, wherewith he may employ his subordinates every one

according to his merits and confer upon each a dignity and a station proportionate
to his powers. He selects ministers and their functionaries from among the people,
and giving a rank and post to each, he relies upon them for the efficient conduct of
affairs spiritual and temporal. If his subjects tread the path of obedience and busy
themselves with their tasks he will keep them untroubled by hardships, so that they
may pass their time at ease in the shadow of his justice. If one of his officers or
ministers commits any impropriety or oppression, he will only keep him at his post
provided that he responds to correction, advice or punishment, and wakes up from
the sleep of negligence; if he fails to mend his ways, he will retain him no longer,
but change him for someone who is deserving; and when his subjects are ungrateful
for benefits and do not appreciate security and ease, but ponder treachery in their
hearts, shewing unruliness and overstepping their bounds, he will admonish them for
their misdeeds, and punish them in proportion to their crimes. Having done that he
will cover their sins with the skirt of pardon and oblivion. Further he will bring to
pass that which concerns the advance of civilization, such as constructing
underground channels, digging main canals, building bridges across great waters,
rehabilitating villages and farms, raising fortifications, building new towns, and
erecting lofty buildings and magnificent dwellings; he will have inns built on the
highways and schools for those who seek knowledge; for which things he will be
renowned for ever; he will gather the fruit of his good works in the next world and
blessings will be showered upon him.…

Darke (London: Rout-ledge and Kegan Paul, 1960), 9–13, 62–65. Reprinted by
permission of the publisher.
4.… [God] furnished [the King] with powers and merits such as had been lacking
in the princes of the world before him, and endowed him with all that is needful for
a king—such as a comely appearance, a kindly disposition, integrity, manliness,
bravery, horsemanship, knowledge, [skill in] the use of various kinds of arms and
accomplishment in several arts, pity and mercy upon the creatures of God,
[strictness in] the performance of vows and promises, sound faith and true belief,
devotion to the worship of God and the practice of such virtuous deeds as praying in
the night, supererogatory fasting, respect for religious authorities, honouring devout
and pious men, winning the society of men of learning and wisdom, giving regular
alms, doing good to the poor, being kind to subordinates and servants, and relieving
the people of oppressors. Following all this God gave him power and dominion as
befitted his worthiness and good faith, and made all the world subject to him,
causing his dignity and authority to reach all climes; all the dwellers on earth are his
tributaries, and as long as they seek his favour they are protected by his sword.…
On Recognizing the Extent of God’s Grace towards Kings
3. It has come down in a tradition from The Prophet (may Allah bless him and
save him) that on the day of the resurrection, when anyone is brought forward who
[in his life] wielded power and command over God’s creatures, his hands will be
bound; if he has been just, his justice will loose his hands and send him to paradise;
but if he has been unjust, his injustice will cast him into hell as he is, with his hands
bound in chains.
4. There is also a tradition that on resurrection day whoever had any command in
this world over God’s creatures, even over the inhabitants of his own house or over
his own underlings, will be questioned about it; likewise the shepherd who tended
his sheep will be required to answer for that too.

5. They say that at the time of his father’s leaving this world [caliph] ‘Abd Allah
ibn ‘Umar ibn al Khattab (may Allah be pleased with them both) asked, ‘O father,
where and when shall I see you again?’ ‘Umar said, ‘In the next world.’ ‘Abd Allah
said, ‘I would it were sooner.’ He said, ‘You will see me in a dream tonight,
tomorrow night, or the next night.’ Twelve years passed by without his appearing in
a dream. Then one night he saw him in a dream and said, ‘O father, did you not say
that within three nights I should see you?’ He said, ‘O son, I was occupied, because
in the country around Baghdad a bridge had become dilapidated and officials had
not attended to repairing it. One day a sheep’s forefoot fell into a hole on that
bridge and was broken. Till now I have been answering for that.’
6. Of a certainty The Master of the World (may Allah perpetuate his reign) should
know that on that great day he will be asked to answer for all those of God’s
creatures who are under his command, and if he tries to transfer [his responsibility]
to someone else he will not be listened to. Since this is so it behoves the king not to
leave this important matter to anyone else, and not to disregard the state of God’s
creatures. To the best of his ability let him ever acquaint himself, secretly and
openly, with their conditions; let him protect them from extortionate hands, and
preserve them from cruel tyrants, so that the blessings resulting from those actions
may come about in the time of his rule, if Allah wills.…
1. It is incumbent upon the king to enquire into religious matters, to be
acquainted with the divine precepts and prohibitions and put them into practice,
and to obey the commands of God (be He exalted); it is his duty to respect doctors
of religion and pay their salaries out of the treasury, and he should honour pious
and abstemious men. Furthermore it is fitting that once or twice a week he should
invite religious elders to his presence and hear from them the commands of The
Truth; he should listen to interpretations of the Quran and traditions of The Prophet
(may Allah pray for him and give him peace); and he should hear stories about just
kings and tales of the prophets (upon them be peace). During that time he should
free his mind from worldly cares and give his ears and attention [wholly] to them.
Let him bid them take sides and hold a debate, and let him ask questions about what
he does not understand; when he has learnt the answers let him commit them to
memory. After this has gone on for some time it will become a habit, and it will not
be long before he has learnt and memorized most of the precepts of divine law, the
meanings of the Quran and the traditions of The Prophet (upon him be peace). Then
the way of prudence and rectitude in both spiritual and temporal affairs will be
open to him; no heretic or innovator will be able to turn him from that path. His
judgment will be strengthened and he will increase in justice and equity; vanity and
heresy will vanish from his kingdom and great works will spring from his hands. The
roots of wickedness, corruption and discord will be cut out in the time of his empire.
The hand of the righteous shall become strong and the wicked shall be no more. In
this world he shall have fame, and in the next world he shall find salvation, high
degree and inestimable reward. In his age men will more than ever delight in
gaining knowledge.…
3. The most important thing which a king needs is sound faith, because kingship
and religion are like two brothers; whenever disturbance breaks out in the country
religion suffers too; heretics and evil-doers appear; and whenever religious affairs
are in disorder, there is confusion in the country; evil-doers gain power and render
the king impotent and despondent; heresy grows rife and rebels make themselves
felt.…

The Story of ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al ‘Aziz and the Famine
10. They say that in the days of ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al ‘Aziz (Allah’s mercy be upon
him) there was a famine and the people were in distress. A party of Arabs
approached him and complained saying, ‘O Commander of the Faithful, we have
consumed our own flesh and blood in the famine (that is, we have become thin),
and our cheeks have turned yellow because we have not enough to eat. We need
what is in your treasury; and as for that treasure, it belongs either to you or to God
or to the servants of God. If it belongs to God’s servants it is ours; if it belongs to
God, He has no need of it; if it is yours, then [as the Quran 12. 88 says] “be
charitable unto us, for Allah will requite the charitable”…; and if it is ours let us
have it that we may escape from these straits, for the skin is withered on our bodies.’
‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al ‘Aziz was moved to sympathy for them, and tears came into his
eyes; he said, ‘I will do as you have said,’ and in the same hour he gave orders for
their requests to be attended to and their wants to be supplied. When they were
about to get up and go, ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al ‘Aziz (Allah’s mercy be upon him) said,
‘O men where are you going? As you presented your case and that of the rest of
God’s servants to me, so do you present my case to God’ (meaning: remember me in
your prayers). Then those Arab tribesmen lifted their eyes to heaven and said, ‘O
Lord, by Thy glory [we pray] that Thou wilt do unto ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al ‘Aziz as he
did unto Thy servants.’
11. When they had done praying, immediately a cloud came up and it began to
rain heavily; a hailstone fell upon the bricks of ‘Umar’s palace; it broke in two and a
piece of paper fell from inside it. They looked at it and there was written upon it [in
Arabic], ‘This is a grace from Allah The Mighty to ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al ‘Aziz
[exempting him] from the fire.’
A CHRISTIAN DEBATE: CANON LAWYERS IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY
The growth of state power, including the claims of the emperor of Germany, raised
new church-state issues in Europe by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. A famous
controversy in the eleventh century had pitted Pope Gregory VII against
From Brian Tierney, The Crisis of Church and State, 1050–1300 (Englewood Cliffs,
N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1964), 122–26.
the emperor Henry IV over the issue of whether secular rulers had any right to
appoint bishops. Gregory insisted on the supremacy of the church in religious
matters and, by absolving Germans of religious obligations to obey their ruler, got
the emperor to back down. The following debate, from the end of the twelfth
century, is between two eminent jurists. Church (canon) law was becoming more
elaborate, and the revival of Roman law provided different arguments about the
state. In this debate Huguccio favors the emperor’s side. Alanus uses interpretations
of the Bible, including the idea that Christ conveyed his authority to Peter, who
became the first pope, plus claims about the power Constantine gave the church, to
support papal supremacy.
•••
HUGUCCIO: After the coming of the Truth. Up until the coming of Christ the imperial
and pontifical rights were not separated, for the same man was emperor and pontiff.
… But the offices and rights of the emperor and the pontiff were separated by Christ
and some things, namely temporal affairs, were assigned to the emperor, others,
namely spiritual affairs, to the pontiff, and this was done for the sake of preserving

humility and avoiding pride. If the emperor or the pontiff held all offices he would
easily grow proud but now since each needs the other and sees that he is not fully
self-sufficient he is made humble.… Here it can clearly be gathered that each power,
the apostolic and imperial, was instituted by God and that neither is derived from
the other and that the emperor does not have the sword from the apostle.… All
these contrary arguments seem to imply that the emperor receives the power of the
sword and the imperial authority from the apostle and that the pope makes him
emperor and can depose him. I believe however, that the emperor has the power of
the sword and the imperial dignity from election by the princes and people, … for
there was an emperor before there was a pope, an empire before a papacy. Again the
words, “Behold, here are two swords” (Luke 22:38), were spoken to symbolize the
fact that the two powers, namely the apostolic and imperial, are distinct and
separate. If, therefore, it is anywhere stated or implied that the emperor has the
power of the sword from the pope, I understand it as meaning the unction and
confirmation which he has from the pope when he swears fidelity to him; for before
this, although he is not called emperor, he is an emperor as regards dignity though
not as regards unction, and before this he has the power of the sword and exercises
it. When it is said that the pope can depose him I believe this to be true, but by the
will and consent of the princes if he is convicted before them. Then I take it, in the
last resort, if he has been convicted and admonished and will not desist or give
satisfaction, he should be excommunicated and all should be removed from
[loyalty] to him.… If still he is not corrected then finally he is justly smitten with a
sentence and rightly expelled by armed force, and another legitimately elected. But
by whom is the sentence pronounced? By the lord pope before whom he was
convicted or by his princes if the Roman pontiff has approved this.
ALANUS: This indeed is certain according to everyone, that the pope has jurisdiction
over the emperor in spiritual matters so that he can bind and loose him… but,
according to Huguccio, by no means in temporal matters though the pope can judge
him in temporal matters and depose him by the wish of the princes who elect him
according to customary law. According to Huguccio the emperor has the sword from
God alone and not from the pope except as regards coronation and confirmation,
and he has full imperial jurisdiction beforehand although he is not called emperor.
But in truth, and according to the Catholic faith, he is subject to the pope in
spiritual matters and also receives his sword from him, for the right of both swords
belongs to the pope. This is proved by the fact that the Lord had both swords on
earth and used both as is mentioned here, and he established Peter as his vicar on
earth and all Peter’s successors. Therefore today Innocent has by right the material
sword. If you deny this you are saying that Christ established a secular prince as his
vicar in this regard. Again Peter said to the Lord, “Behold, here are two swords”
(Luke 22:38), so the material sword too was with Peter. Again if the emperor was
not subject to the pope in temporalities he could not sin against the church in
temporalities. Again the church is one body and so it shall have only one head or it
will be a monster.
This opinion is not invalidated by the fact that there were emperors before there
were popes, because they were only de facto emperors, and none except those who
believed in the true God had a right to the sword; nor do infidel rulers have it
nowadays. Likewise it is not invalidated by the fact that Constantine conferred
temporal jurisdiction on [pope] Sylvester.…
From his plenitude of right the pope could take away the City and other
possessions even if the emperor was unwilling.

The emperor then has the sword from the pope. The electors indeed confer it on
him, not the pope, but every bishop has his bishopric from the pope and yet the
pope does not confer it but rather canonical election of the clergy does. The pope
therefore is the ordinary judge of the emperor in both temporal and spiritual affairs
and can depose him. … But can he depose him for any crime? I answer, rather for
none, unless he is determined to persist in it, and even then perhaps not for any
offence but only for those which harm the people, as for instance the continued
discord of heresy. But could the pope keep the material sword for himself if he
wished? I answer no, because the Lord divided the swords as is said here, and the
church would be gravely disturbed by this.…

CHAPTER 9
CONDITIONS OF WOMEN IN ISLAM, BYZANTINE CHRISTIANITY, AND WESTERN
CHRISTIANITY
The major world religions were at pains to deal with conditions for women, through
their treatments of family law and in more general discussions of women’s role in
human society. Both Christianity and Islam faced a major tension in principle: they
granted women souls and the chance of salvation, but they regarded women as
inferior, more prone to evil. Neither religion undermined patriarchy. But both
religions granted women opportunities for religious expression: they could go on
pilgrimages, for example. Both Muhammad and some early Christian leaders
believed they were giving women important new opportunities through family law
and religious prescriptions.
Attention to women’s conditions is an important aspect of world history in the
postclassical period. It involves two kinds of calculations: the first is the comparison
of similarities and differences among major societies, such as the two Christian
religions and Islam; the second is assessment of change over time, when patterns are
compared to those of the classical period.
The following selections come from laws and commentary in the Byzantine
Empire, the center of Orthodox Christianity; from Catholic Western Europe; and
from Islam. There are many similarities in the complex statements of patriarchy in
all three religions, and these should be the first points to identify. Are there also
differences?
The Byzantine Empire obviously shared Christianity with Western Europe, though
its Orthodox institutions were separate. Orthodox Christianity continued to allow
priests to marry, which may have signaled less fear about sexuality and
contamination through contact with women than arose in the West. Because the
Byzantine Empire preserved Roman laws and political institutions, it might also
have offered some extra protections for women—Rome had been rather careful to
combine patriarchy with legal conditions.
Islam poses some obvious problems for interpretation, both in the postclassical
period and today. Arab peoples before Islam had a strongly patriarchal society in
which women’s family rights were not well established. Muhammad believed he
added important protections for women—allowing them to divorce, for example,
which was simply not possible in Christianity. On the other hand, Islam did not
make women equal; they even prayed separately from men. Some Muslims continue
the debate today, arguing that feminism is less necessary in Islam than in Christian
cultures, because women’s rights were more carefully protected in the religion itself.
Are there bases for this argument in the materials derived from religious history?
Questions
1. How does the distinctive power of a particular woman, such as Anna Comnena,
the mother of a Byzantine emperor, affect interpretations of women’s conditions
more generally? Does it suggest that the patriarchal system had been modified?
2. Why did canon law punish men for adultery more than women (at least in
principle)? How does this relate to patriarchal views about women?
3. How did the Quran and Christian church (canon) law reflect beliefs in the

spiritual equality of both genders?
4. What were the crucial tensions in Islam concerning women’s spiritual status,
rights, and treatment?
5. In what ways is it clear that Byzantium, Western Europe, and the Islamic Middle
East were all patriarchal societies, with women held to be distinctly inferior?
6. Did specific religions (along with other factors) change women’s lives?
7. Why were Byzantium and Islam both at pains to distinguish between women’s
private roles and rights and their public roles? Did religion have anything to do
with this distinction?
8. In which society were women’s property rights better protected, Islam or Western
Christianity? Can you think of factors besides religion that might contribute to the
difference? Was the Muslim provision of divorce, compared to Christian family
law, a distinct advantage for women (even though their divorce rights were
inferior to those of men)?
For Further Discussion
1. Compared to the patriarchal systems of classical civilizations (see chapter 5),
were women’s conditions improved by the impact of world religions such as Islam
and Christianity? In which cultural system, Confucianism or Islam, would a
woman be most protected? Which system would be most hostile to female
infanticide, and why? How and why did the cultures differ about divorce?
2. Assuming you were an upper-class woman, in which of the three societies would
you prefer to have lived during the postclassical period, and why—or do you
regard them all as equally confining?
3. Why do some women in the contemporary Middle East argue that Western-style
feminism is not necessary because women’s rights can be maintained through
Islam?
WOMEN IN ISLAM
The prophet Muhammad devoted considerable attention to women in the Quran, the
holy book of Islam held to be inspired by Allah. The strong Islamic tendency to offer
rules for various human affairs is demonstrated in detailed family laws, which in
turn reveal both key principles applied to women and practical features of women’s
lives in Islamic societies. The second selection is from the Hadith, which consists of
collections of traditions attributed to Muhammad and other early leaders from the
seventh century onward; the Hadith set forth further rules and guidelines for
Muslims. A short third selection, from Islamic law in the eleventh century, deals
with public issues.

THE QURAN

O people, observe your Lord; the One who created you from one being and created
from it its mate, then spread from the two many men and women.…
You shall not covet the qualities bestowed on each other by God; the men enjoy
certain qualities, and women enjoy certain qualities.…
The men are made responsible for the women, since God endowed them with
certain qualities, and made them the bread earners. The righteous women will

cheerfully accept this arrangement, and observe God’s commandments, even when
alone in their privacy. If you experience opposition from the women, you shall first
talk to them, then [you may use such negative incentives as] deserting them in bed,
then you may beat them. If they obey you, you are not permitted to transgress
against them.…
The Muslim men, the Muslim women, the believing men, the believing women,
the obedient men, the obedient women, the truthful men, the truthful women, the
steadfast men, the steadfast women, the reverent men, the reverent women, the
charitable men, the charitable women, the fasting men, the fasting women, the
chaste men, the chaste women, and the men who commemorate God frequently, and
the commemorating women; God has prepared for them forgiveness and a great
recompense.…

Inheritance

Men ought to have a part of what their parents and kindred leave behind them when
they die: and women also ought to have a part of what their parents and kindred
leave, whether it be little, or whether it be much; a definite part is due to them.
GOD hath thus commanded you concerning your children. A male shall have as
much as the share of two females; but if they be females only, and above two in
number, they shall have two third parts of what the deceased shall leave; and if
there be but one, she shall have the half.
O true believers, it is not lawful for you to be heirs of women against their will,
nor to hinder them from marrying others, that ye may take away part of what ye
have given them in dowry; unless they have been guilty of a manifest crime: but
converse kindly with them. And if ye hate him, it may happen that ye may hate a
thing wherein GOD hath placed much good.
Divorce

Those who intend to estrange their wives shall wait four months [for cooling off]; if
they reconcile, then God is Forgiver, Most Merciful. If they go through with the
divorce, then God is Hearer, Knower. The divorced women shall wait three
menstruations [before marrying another man]. It is not lawful for them to conceal
what God has created in their wombs, if they believe in God and the Last Day. [In
case of pregnancy,] the husband’s wishes shall supersede the wife’s wishes if he
wants to remarry her. The women have rights, as well as obligations, equitably.
Thus, the men’s wishes prevail [in case of pregnancy]. God is Almighty, Most Wise.
…
The divorcees also shall be provided for, equitably. This is a duty upon the
righteous.…
If you wish to marry another wife, in place of your present wife, and you had
given the latter a great deal, you shall not take back anything you had given her.
Would you take it fraudulently, maliciously, and sinfully? How could you take it
back, after you have been intimate with each other, and after they have taken from
you a solemn pledge?…
If a couple fears separation, you shall appoint an arbitrator from his family and
an arbitrator from her family; if they decide to reconcile, God will help them get

together.…
They consult you; say, “GOD decrees for you the inheritance statutes concerning
the loner. If one dies and leaves no children, and he had a sister, she gets half the
inheritance. If there were two sisters, they get two-thirds of the inheritance. If the
siblings are men and women, the male gets a share equal to that of two females.”
God thus clarifies for you, lest you go astray. God is fully aware of all things.…
The thief, male or female, you shall mark their hands as a punishment for their
crime, and to serve as a deterrent from GOD. GOD is Almighty, Most Wise.…
Anyone who works righteousness, male or female, while believing, we will surely
grant them a happy life in this world, and we will surely pay them their full
recompense (on the Day of Judgment) for their righteous works.
THE HADITH

He who shows concern for the widows and the unfortunate [ranks as high] as one
who goes on Jihād in the way of Allah, or one who fasts by day and who rises at
night [for prayer].
To look at a woman is forbidden, even if it is a look without desire, so how much
the more is touching her.
Said he—upon whom be Allah’s blessing and peace—: “Avoid seven pernicious
things.” [His Companions] said: “And what are they, O Apostle of Allah?” He
answered: “Associating anything with Allah, sorcery, depriving anyone of life where
Allah has forbidden that save for just cause, taking usury, devouring the property of
orphans, turning the back on the day of battle, and slandering chaste believing
women even though they may be acting carelessly.”
Said the Prophet—upon whom be Allah’s blessing and peace—: “I had a look into
Paradise and I saw that the poor made up most of its inhabitants, and I had a look
into Hell and saw that most of its inhabitants were women.”
Treat women-folk kindly for woman was created of a rib. The crookedest part of
a rib is its upper part. If you go to straighten it out you will break it, and if you
leave it alone it will continue crooked. So treat women in kindly fashion.
Rules For Muslim Government, Eleventh Century
Exclusion of Women

Nobody may be appointed to the office of qadi [judge] who does not comply fully
with the conditions required to make his appointment valid and his decisions
effective.… The first condition is that he must be a man. This condition consists of
two qualities, puberty and masculinity. As for the child below puberty, he cannot be
held accountable, nor can his utterances have effect against himself; how much less
so against others. As for women, they are unsuited to positions of authority,
although judicial verdicts may be based on what they say. Abu Hanifa said that a
woman can act as qadi in matters on which it would be lawful for her to testify, but
she may not act as qadi in matters on which it would not be lawful for her to testify.
Ibn Jarir al-Tabari, giving a divergent view, allows a woman to act as qadi in all
cases, but no account should be taken of an opinion which is refuted by both the
consensus of the community and the word of God. “Men have authority over women
because of what God has conferred on the one in preference to the other” [Koran
4:38], meaning by this, intelligence and discernment. He does not, therefore, permit
women to hold authority over men.

THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE
Byzantine family law, not surprisingly, reflected Roman principles, particularly early
in the empire. The most important early Byzantine emperor, Justinian (483–565),
had codified Roman law. A marriage contract of the eighth century reflects careful
concern for legal equity. The Byzantine Empire also produced some extraordinary
individual women. Justinian’s wife, the empress Theodora, probably made key
policy decisions. During the eleventh and twelfth centuries the Comnenus family
dominated the imperial line, producing a period of stable, enlightened rule. The
princess Anna was a noteworthy historian, and in the second selection below she
describes the role of her grandmother, an empress, in affairs of state. Finally,
another law code, from about 900 in the reign of Leo VI, suggests another facet of
gender relations in the empire. Does it represent a change from the principles
expressed in the earlier marriage contract?
•••
A MARRIAGE CONTRACT

The marriage of Christians, man and woman, who have reached years of discretion,
that is for a man at fifteen and for a woman at thirteen years of age, both being
desirous and having obtained the consent of their parents, shall be contracted either
by deed or by parol.
A written marriage contract shall be based upon a written agreement providing
the wife’s marriage portion; and it shall be made before three credible witnesses
according to the new decrees auspiciously prescribed by us. The man on his part
agreeing by it continually to protect and preserve undiminished the wife’s marriage
portion, and also such additions as he may naturally make thereto in augmentation
thereof; and it shall be recorded in the agreement made on that behalf by him, that
in case there are no children, one-fourth part thereof shall be secured in settlement.
From Bernard Lewis, ed. and trans. Islam: From the Prophet Muhammed to the
Capture of Constantinople, vol. 2, Religion and Society (New York: Oxford
University Press, 1974), 40. Reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press.
If the wife happens to predecease the husband and there are no children of the
marriage, the husband shall receive only one-fourth part of the wife’s portion for
himself, and the remainder thereof shall be given to the beneficiaries named in the
wife’s will or, if she be intestate, to the next of kin. If the husband predeceases the
wife, and there are no children of the marriage, then all the wife’s portion shall
revert to her, and so much of all her husband’s estate as shall be equal to a fourth
part of his portion shall also inure to her as her own, and the remainder of his estate
shall revert either to his beneficiaries or, if he be intestate, to his next of kin.
If the husband predecease the wife and there are children of the marriage, the
wife being their mother, she shall control her marriage portion and all her husband’s
property as becomes the head of the family and household.
A HISTORY OF ANNA COMNENA (TWELFTH CENTURY, GRANDDAUGHTER OF EMPEROR ALEXIUS I)

One might be amazed that my father accorded his mother such high honor in these

matters and that he deferred to her in all respects, as if he were turning over the
reins of the empire to her and running alongside her while she drove the imperial
chariot, contenting himself simply with the title of emperor. Indeed, he had already
passed beyond the period of boyhood, an age especially when lust for power grows
in men of such nature [as Alexius]. He took upon himself the wars against the
barbarians and whatever battles and combats pertained to them, while he entrusted
to his mother the complete management of [civil] affairs: the selection of civil
magistrates, the collection of incoming revenues and the expenses of the
government. A person who has reached this point in my text may blame my father
for entrusting management of the empire to the gynaiconites [women’s section of
the palace]. But if he had known this woman’s spirit, how great she was in virtue
and intellect and how extremely vigorous, he would cease his reproach and his
criticism would be changed into admiration. For my grandmother was so dextrous in
handling affairs of state and so highly skilled in controlling and running the
government, that she was not only able to manage the Roman empire but could
have handled every empire under the sun. She had a vast amount of experience and
understood the internal workings of many things: she knew how each affair began
and to what result it might lead, which actions were destructive and which rather
were beneficial. She was exceedingly acute in discerning whatever course of action
was necessary and in carrying it out safely. She was not only acute in her thought,
but was no less proficient in her manner of speech. Indeed, she was a persuasive
orator, neither verbose nor stretching her phrases out at great length; nor did she
quickly lose the sense of her argument. What she began felicitously she would finish
even more so.…

1926), 72–74. Reprinted with the permission of Cambridge University Press.
From Anna Comnena, Alexiade, vol. 1 (London, 1928), 123–25.
But, as I was saying, my father, after he had assumed power, managed by himself
the strains and labors of war, while making his mother a spectator to these actions,
but in other affairs he set her up as ruler, and as if he were her servant he used to
say and do whatever she ordered. The emperor loved her deeply and was dependent
upon her advice (so much affection had he for his mother), and he made his right
hand the executor of her orders, his ears paid heed to her words, and everything
which she accepted or rejected the emperor likewise accepted or rejected. …
Everything which she decided or ordered he found satisfactory. Not only was he very
obedient to her as is fitting for a son to his mother, but even more he submitted his
spirit to her as to a master in the science [episteme] of ruling. For he felt that she
had attained perfection in everything and far surpassed all men of that time in
prudence and in comprehension of affairs.
LEGAL STATUS

I do not know why the ancient authorities, without having thoroughly considered
the subject, conferred upon women the right of acting as witnesses. It was, indeed,
well known, and they themselves could not fail to be aware that it was dishonorable
for them to appear frequently before the eyes of men, and that those who were
modest and virtuous should avoid doing so. For this reason, as I have previously
stated, I do not understand why they permitted them to be called as witnesses, a
privilege which resulted in their frequently being associated with great crowds of
men, and holding conversation with them of a character very unbecoming to the
sex.…

And, indeed, the power to act as witnesses in the numerous assemblies of men
with which they mingle, as well as taking part in public affairs, gives them the habit
of speaking more freely than they ought, and, depriving them of the morality and
reserve of their sex, encourages them in the exercise of boldness and wickedness
which, to some extent, is even insulting to men. For is it not an insult, and a very
serious one, for women to be authorized to do something which is especially within
the province of the male sex?
Wherefore, with a view to reforming not only the errors of custom, but also of
law, We hereby deprive them of the power of acting as witnesses, and by this
constitution forbid them to be called to witness contracts under any circumstances.
But, so far as matters in which they are exclusively interested are concerned, and
when men cannot act as witnesses, as, for instance, in confinements, and other
things where only women are allowed to be present, they can give testimony as to
what is exclusively their own, and which should be concealed from the eyes of men.

WESTERN EUROPE : CITY AND CANON LAW
The following two documents outline both secular and religious laws concerning
women and their rights in marriage. The city of Magdeburg, in northern Germany,
was a prosperous center by the thirteenth century, and many merchant families
would have had considerable disposable wealth. The codification of canon law on
marriage was part of the general systematization of church law—and the rise of
lawyers—as European society became more elaborate with economic advance, the
growth of cities, and cultural change. An obvious question: were the provisions of
the two types of law, city and church, essentially compatible, even as they focused
on different sets of details?
•••
A GERMAN CITY’S LAWS, 1261

14. If a man dies leaving a wife, she shall have no share in his property except what
he has given her in court, or has appointed for her dower. She must have six
witnesses, male or female, to prove her dower. If the man made no provision for her,
her children must support her as long as she does not remarry. If her husband had
sheep, the widow shall take them.…
18. No one, whether man or woman, shall, on his sick-bed, give away more than
three shillings’ worth of his property without the consent of his heirs, and the
woman must have the consent of her husband.…
55. When a man dies his wife shall give [to his heirs] his sword, his horse and
saddle, and his best coat of mail. She shall also give a bed, a pillow, a sheet, a
tablecloth, two dishes and a towel. Some say that she should give other things also,
but that is not necessary. If she does not have these things, she shall not give them,
but she shall give proof for each article that she does not have it.…
57. If the children are minors, the oldest male relative on the father’s side, if he is
of the same rank by birth, shall receive all these things and preserve them for the
children. … He shall also be the guardian of the widow until she remarries, if he is
of the same rank as she is.
58. After giving the above articles the widow shall take her dower and all that

belongs to her; that is, all the sheep, geese, chests, yarn, beds, pillows,… etc., and
there are many other trinkets which belong to her. … But uncut cloth, and unworked
gold and silver do not belong to her.

History (New York: Charles Scribner’s, 1907), 592, 594–95, 600–601.
CHURCH (CANON) LAW ON MARRIAGE, TWELFTH CENTURY

1. [According to John Chrysostom, a leading early theologian:] “Coitus does not
make a marriage; consent does; and therefore the separation of the body does not
dissolve it, but the separation of the will. Therefore he who forsakes his wife, and
does not take another, is still a married man. For even if he is now separated in his
body, yet he is still joined in his will. When therefore he takes another woman, then
he forsakes fully. Therefore he who forsakes is not the adulterer, but he who takes
another woman.”
2. … When therefore there is consent, which alone makes a marriage, between
those persons, it is clear that they have been married.…
22. A man may not make a monastic vow without his wife’s consent.…
If any married man wishes to join a monastery, he is not to be accepted, unless he
has first been released by his wife, and she makes a vow of chastity. For if she,
through incontinence, marries another man while he is still living, without a doubt
she will be an adulteress.…
24. A husband is not permitted to be celibate without his wife’s consent.…
26. A wife is not permitted to take a vow of celibacy, unless her husband chooses
the same way of life.…
Betrothals may not be contracted before the age of seven. For only the consent is
contracted, which cannot happen unless it is understood by each party what is being
done between them. Therefore it is shown that betrothals cannot be contracted
between children, whose weakness of age does not admit consent. … Therefore those
who give girls to boys while they are still in the cradle, and vice versa, achieve
nothing, even if the father and mother are willing and do this, unless both of the
children consent after they have reached the age of understanding.…
14. Childbirth is the sole purpose of marriage for women.…
23. Adultery in either sex is punished in the same way.…
1. A fornicator cannot forsake his wife for fornication.…
4. Men are to be punished more severely for adultery than women.

CHAPTER 10
FEUDALISM IN WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN
Along with the impact of the world religions on the state, a key development in the
postclassical period was the formation of governments in new areas. This chapter
focuses on distinctive features of that process in Western Europe and Japan,
providing another opportunity to deal with key political developments in the
postclassical period.
The general issue was this: societies that arose on the fringes of the classical world
—including Russia and parts of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as Japan and
northwestern Europe—often were forming governments with no particular historical
precedent. At most, very loose, essentially tribal kingships had emerged before (save
in parts of Africa, where more elaborate states preceded this period). In the absence
of highly developed economies, well-established political legitimacy, or even many
trained officials, it was difficult to form elaborate states. Western Europe tried
briefly to revive the Roman Empire (under the emperor Charlemagne, around 800
C.E.) but did not succeed. Japan made an attempt to imitate the Chinese Empire in
the seventh century but could not.
In Japan and Western Europe, the political relationships known as feudalism
provided a less demanding political system. Feudalism linked local and regional
military leaders—the lords—with some other military personnel. This was a system
for elites: it did not directly involve the masses of ordinary people. A lord formed
ties with other people who had the equipment (horses, some armor, and weaponry)
necessary to fight. He offered them protection and often his support or some land, or
both, in return for their loyalty and their service in war. This was the essence of the
feudal system. It could provide some orderliness in individual regions, as opposed to
endemic local fighting; when it was extended to larger units, through feudal ties
among great lords themselves, it could even support a monarchy.
Both Japan and Western Europe established this system in the postclassical
period, out of similar needs. They were not in contact with each other, so it is not
surprising that the two feudalisms, though remarkably similar, had some differences
—differences that would affect the two areas long after feudalism itself had
perished. In both cases, however, central rulers (like later English Kings or shoguns
from the Minamoto family) could use feudalism to organize larger networks of
royalty. Here, then, is another comparison of societies without contact, developing
separately but resembling each other to an intriguing degree.
Feudalism in these two societies, at opposite ends of Eurasia, though remarkably
similar in origins and structure, had somewhat different consequences in the long
run. European feudalism developed into efforts to institutionalize contractual
relationships between rulers and vassals; it led in turn to early versions of
parliaments set up to try to make sure that rulers would stay within agreed-upon
bounds. Japanese feudalism’s greater stress on loyalty led not to parliaments—which
would arrive only through much later imitation of the West—but to a sense of group
cohesiveness that still describes aspects of Japanese management style and political
life.
Questions
1. What basic characteristics of feudalism emerge from the European and Japanese

materials? What did lords and vassals gain from a feudal tie? What were their
respective obligations?
2. How was the Magna Carta a feudal document? How had the king violated
feudalism, and what remedies were proposed?
3. In what ways is it clear that vassals, though required to be loyal to their lords,
were basically in the same social class and not to be treated as social inferiors?
4. How much difference was there between the loyalty emphases in Japanese
feudalism and those in the European version? Would European vassals have agreed
with the extent of devotion displayed in the Japanese Tale of the Heike? Would
Japanese vassals have agreed with the approach taken in the Magna Carta?
For Further Discussion
1. What conditions account for the emergence of such similar political systems in
Western Europe and Japan?
2. What would a Confucian bureaucrat think of feudalism? On what grounds would
he criticize it? Would he prefer the Western or the Japanese version?
3. Are there any remnants of feudal ideas and institutions in the Western world
today? Why do some observers argue that the special qualities of Japanese
feudalism, removed from specific feudal institutions, are still useful in Japan
today?
4. How could western feudal elites move to the idea of parliaments, composed of
these and other elites who advised the king as feudal lord? Why would this
particular evolution of feudalism be more difficult in Japan?
5. What are the differences between feudal and modern ideas of limited
government?
EUROPEAN FEUDALISM
Feudal documents were legal records for the most part, and often short. What
follows are various documents dating from the seventh to the twelfth centuries that
treat different aspects of French and English feudalism.
In the first document, a pagan, that is non-Christian, Viking duke whose people
had conquered Normandy is induced to enter a feudal relationship with the king of
France, along with marriage to one of the king’s daughters. What would each party
get out of this relationship? Two documents then describe common feudal property
grants and a standard oath of loyalty in what was a very ritual relationship. Next, a
well-known French bishop offers a more general description—obviously somewhat
idealized—of what feudalism involved. Then a document describes conditions of
separation, while another document highlights standard vassal obligations.
The final document offers excerpts from the English Magna Carta, or great
charter, which the feudal barons imposed by force of arms on King John in 1215 in
defense of feudal rights. John had been trying to extend government powers, and the
passages suggest how new parliamentary-style institutions might emerge from
feudalism.

EUROPEAN FEUDAL DOCUMENTS
1. Granting Normandy (Tenth Century)

Immediately Charles [French king], having consulted with them, sent Franco,
Archbishop of Rouen, to Rollo, Duke of the [Viking] Pagans. Coming to him he
began to speak with mild words. “Most exalted and distinguished of dukes, will you
quarrel with the Franks as long as you live? Will you always wage war on them?
What will become of you when you are seized by death? Whose creature are you?
Do you think you are God? Are you not a man formed from filth? Are you not dust
and ashes and food for worms? Remember what you are and will be and by whose
judgment you will be condemned. You will experience Hell I think, and no longer
injure anyone by your wars. If you are willing to become a Christian you will be
able to enjoy peace in the present and the future and to dwell in this world with
great riches. Charles, a long-suffering king, persuaded by the counsel of his men, is
willing to give you this coastal province that you and Halstigno have grievously
ravaged. He will also give you his daughter, Gisela, for a wife in order that peace
and concord and a firm, stable and continuous friendship may endure for all time
between you and him.…”
From Brian Tierney, Sources of Medieval History, vol. 1 (New York: Alfred A. Knopf,
1978), 126–29, 131, 133-35.
At the agreed time Charles and Rollo came together at the place that had been
decided on.… Looking on Rollo, the invader of France, the Franks said to one
another, “This duke who has fought such battles against the warriors of this realm is
a man of great power and great courage and prowess and good counsel and of great
energy too.” Then, persuaded by the words of the Franks, Rollo put his hands
between the hands of the king, a thing which his father and grandfather and greatgrandfather had never done; and so the king gave his daughter Gisela in marriage to
the duke and conferred on him the agreed lands from the River Epte to the sea as his
property in hereditary right, together with all Brittany from which he could live.…
2. Granting Fiefs (Landed Estates) (Seventh Century)

Those who from their early youth have served us or our parents faithfully are justly
rewarded by the gifts of our munificence. Know therefore that we have granted to
that illustrious man (name), with greatest good will, the villa called (name), situated
in the county of (name), with all its possessions and extent, in full as it was formerly
held by him or by our treasury. Therefore by the present charter which we command
to be observed forever, we decree that the said (name) shall possess the villa of
(name), as has been said, in its entirety, with lands, houses, buildings, inhabitants,
slaves, woods, pastures, meadows, streams, mills, and all its appurtenances and
belongings, and with all the subjects of the royal treasury who dwell on the lands,
and he shall hold it forever with full immunity from the entrance of any public
official for the purpose of exacting the royal portion of the fines from cases arising
there: to the extent finally that he shall have, hold, and possess it in full ownership,
no one having the right to expect its transfer, and with the right of leaving it to his
successors or to anyone whom he desires, and to do with it whatever else he wishes.
3. Oaths of Loyalty

Thus shall one take the oath of fidelity:
By the Lord before whom this sanctuary is holy, I will to N. be true and faithful,
and love all which he loves and shun all which he shuns, according to the laws of
God and the order of the world. Nor will I ever with will or action, through word or
deed, do anything which is unpleasing to him, on condition that he will hold to me
as I shall deserve it, and that he will perform everything as it was in our agreement

when I submitted myself to him and chose his will.
It is right that those who offer to us unbroken fidelity should be protected by our
aid. And since such and such a faithful one of ours, by the favor of God, coming
here in our palace with his arms, has seen fit to swear trust and fidelity to us in our
hand, therefore we decree and command by the present precept that for the future
such and such above mentioned be counted with the number of [followers]. And if
anyone perchance should presume to kill him, let him know that he will be judged
guilty of his [value] of 600 shillings.
4. Fulbert, Bishop of Chartres, on Feudal Obligations (1020)

To William most glorious duke of the Aquitanians, bishop Fulbert the favor of his
prayers.
Asked to write something concerning the form of fealty, I have noted briefly for
you on the authority of the books the things which follow. He who swears fealty to
his lord ought always to have these six things in memory; what is harmless, safe,
honorable, useful, easy, practicable. Harmless, that is to say that he should not be
injurious to his lord in his body: safe, that he should not be injurious to him in his
secrets or in the defenses through which he is able to be secure; honorable, that he
should not be injurious to him in his justice or in other matters that pertain to his
honor; useful, that he should not be injurious to him in his possessions; easy or
practicable, that that good which his lord is able to do easily, he make not difficult,
nor that which is practicable he make impossible to him.
However, that the faithful vassal should avoid these injuries is proper, but not for
this does he deserve his holding: for it is not sufficient to abstain from evil, unless
what is good is done also. It remains, therefore, that in the same six things
mentioned above he should faithfully counsel and aid his lord, if he wishes to be
looked upon as worthy of his benefice and to be safe concerning the fealty which he
has sworn.
The lord also ought to act toward his faithful vassal reciprocally in all these
things. And if he does not do this he will be justly considered guilty of bad faith, just
as the former, if he should be detected in the avoidance of or the doing of or the
consenting to them, would be perfidious and perjured.…
5. Lords and Vassals (816)

If anyone shall wish to leave his lord (seniorem), and is able to prove against him
one of these crimes, that is, in the first place, if the lord has wished to reduce him
unjustly into servitude; in the second place, if he has taken counsel against his life;
in the third place, if the lord has committed adultery with the wife of his vassal; in
the fourth place, if he has wilfully attacked him with a drawn sword; in the fifth
place, if the lord has been able to bring defence to his vassal after he has
commended his hands to him, and has not done so; it is allowed to the vassal to
leave him. If the lord has perpetrated anything against the vassal in these five points
it is allowed the vassal to leave him.
6. Military Service (1072)

William, king of the English, to Aethelwig, abbot of Evesham, greeting. I command
you to summon all those who are under your charge and administration that they
shall have ready before me at Clarendon on the octave of Pentecost all the knights
that they owe me. Come to me likewise yourself on that day, and bring ready with
you those five knights that you owe me from your abbey.

THE MAGNA CARTA

John, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of Normandy and
Aquitaine, and count of Anjou, to the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, barons,
justiciars, foresters, sheriffs, stewards, servants, and to all his bailiffs and loyal
persons, greeting. Know that, having regard to God and for the salvation of our
souls, and those of all our predecessors and heirs, and unto the honour of God and
the advancement of Holy Church, and for the reform of our realm, by the counsel of
our venerable fathers… we have granted:
XII. No scutage [tax] or aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless by common
counsel of our kingdom, except for ransoming our person, for making our eldest son
a knight, and for marrying our eldest daughter once; and for them there shall not be
levied more than a reasonable aid. In like manner it shall be done concerning aids
from the city of London.
XXIX. No constable shall compel any knight to give money in stead of castle
guard, when he is willing to perform it in his own person, or (if he himself cannot
do it from any reasonable cause) then by another reliable man; and if we have led
him or sent him upon military service, he shall be quit of guard, in proportion to the
time during which he has been on service because of us.
XXXIX. No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned… or exiled or in anyway
destroyed, nor will we go upon him nor send upon him, except by the lawful
judgement of his peers or by the law of the land.
LV. All fines made by us unjustly and against the law of the land, shall be entirely
remitted, or else it shall be done concerning them according to the decision of the
five-and-twenty barons of whom mention is made below in (the clause for) securing
the peace, or according to the judgement of the majority of the same.…
LXI. Since, moreover, for God and the amendment of our kingdom and for the
better allaying of our quarrel that has arisen between us and our barons, we have
granted all these concessions, desirous that they should enjoy them in complete and
firm stability for ever, we give and grant to them the underwritten security, namely,
that the barons choose five-and-twenty barons of the kingdom, whomsoever they
will, who shall be obliged, to observe and hold, and cause to be observed, with all
their might, the peace and liberties which we have granted and confirmed to them
by this our present Charter, so that if we, or our justiciar, or our bailiffs or any one
of our officers, shall in anything be at fault towards anyone, or shall have broken
any one of the articles of the peace or of this security, and the offence be notified to
four barons of the aforesaid five-and-twenty, the said four barons shall come to us
(or to our justiciar, if we are out of the realm) and, laying the transgression before
us, petition to have that transgression redressed without delay. And if we shall not
have corrected the transgression …within forty days, … the four barons aforesaid
shall refer the matter to the rest of the five-and-twenty barons, and those five-andtwenty barons shall, together with the community of the whole land, distrain and
distress us in all possible ways, namely, by seizing our castles, lands, possessions,
and in any other way they can, until redress has been obtained as they deem fit.…
From Statutes of the Realm, vol. 1 (London, 1810), 1 5ff.
JAPANESE FEUDALISM
Japanese feudalism and its origins can be tracked in part through government
decrees. Japan had an emperor from the sixth century onward. But decrees between

the ninth and the twelfth centuries make it clear that the government encountered
increasing difficulties in maintaining order or even disciplining its own officials. In
the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a leading family, the Kamakura
(Minamoto), gained central authority (separate from the emperor, now a largely
religious figurehead). The government, called a shogunate, established feudal ties
with other lords, treating them as vassals with mutual obligations. Documents 3 and
4 suggest some of the characteristics, advantages, and limitations of this feudal
monarchy system. The final two documents describe Japanese feudal ideals. The
Tale of the Heike was a well-known story of the wars that led up to the Kamakura
shogunate, written shortly thereafter; it is followed by a letter from a samurai—the
characteristic vassal-warrior—to his son.

JAPANESE FEUDAL DOCUMENTS
1. On Matters Relating to the Business of a Province (1114)

1. Preventing riotous behavior.
When a newly appointed governor travels to the province to which he is assigned,
some of his rōtō [entourage] and other followers either rob things from other
persons or engage in quarrels among themselves. It is therefore ordered that a newly
appointed governor must select from among his rōtō, pure and strong persons who
can engage in the task of stopping this kind of behavior.
From David John Lu, ed., Japan: A Documentary History, vol. 1 (Armonk, N.Y.: M. E.
Sharpe), 103–10. Copyright © 1997. Reprinted with permission of M. E. Sharpe, Inc.
2. Do not permit members of your household (ienoko) to speak ill of others, and
prevent unruly actions of your high ranking rōtō.
If on reflection one does not stop those conditions which lead to the use of foul
language, and permit one’s rōtō to engage freely in slandering or heaping abuse on
others… as these things continue to multiply, people will start ridiculing you. When
you take the responsibility of serving the public, you are really performing
something good for yourself too. But if you do not put a stop to the abuse that some
of your followers—whether they be your own most beloved children or rōtō—heap
on others, and let this continue [those who are the object of abuse will not serve
you]. In this way, you may not be able to collect taxes and send them to the central
government. You will then gain the reputation of being an ineffectual governor. If
your children and rōtō cannot uphold one another and also help you, your term of
office will be one of emptiness. If all your followers will pursue their own follies,
you will be left with no followers day and night. Then what benefit is there [of
becoming a governor]?
2. Establishment of Relationship between Lord and Vassals (1184)

Following the destruction of the Ichinotani fortification in Settsu Province in the
Second Month, members of the Heike have been plundering the various provinces in
the west, and Genji troops have been sent into the region to check the Heike. One of
the means employed has been the sending of Tachibana Kiminari and his men as an
advance column into Sanuki Province to secure the support of the local lords. They
have since submitted to the Minamoto, and a roster containing their names has been
transmitted to Kamakura [central government]. Today, His Lordship has sent
instructions to the local lords of Sanuki to take their orders from Kiminari.
[Yoritomo’s monogram]

“Ordered to: Immediate vassals of Sanuki Province
“To submit forthwith to the command of Tachibana Kiminari and to join in the
Kyushu campaign.
“At this time when the Heike are plundering your lands, you have indicated your
submission to me. A roster of your names has been submitted to me. It is indeed a
most loyal act on your part. Submit forthwith to the command of Kiminari and
conduct yourselves in a loyal and meritorious manner. Thus ordered.”
3. The Kamakura Shogunate (1232)

Of the duties devolving on Protectors (shugō) in the provinces. In the time of the
august Right General [Yoritomo’s] House, it was settled that those duties should be
the calling out and despatching of the Grand Guard for service at the capital, the
suppression of conspiracies and rebellion and the punishment of murder and
violence (which included night attacks on houses, gang robbery and piracy).…
Be it noted that no person, even if his family were for generations vassals
(gokenin) of the august House of Minamoto is competent to impress [people] for
military service unless he has an investiture [to the land] of the present date.
4. Tale of the Heike

Recognizing each other, master and retainer spurred their horses to join each other.
Seizing Kanehira’s hands, Yoshinaka said: “I would have fought to the death on the
banks of the Kamo at Rokujō. Simply because of you, however, I have galloped here
through the enemy swarms.”
“It was very kind of you, my lord,” replied Kanehira. “I too would have fought to
the death at Seta. But in fear of your uncertain fate, I have come this way.”
“We are still tied by karma,” said Yoshinaka. “There must be more of my men
around here, for I have seen them scattered among the hills. Unroll the banner and
raise it high!”…
At this challenge, [the enemy commander] Tadayori shouted to his men: “Now,
hear this! He is the commander of our enemy. Let him not escape! All men—to the
attack!”… When Yoshinaka found himself alone with Kanehira, he sighed: “My
armor has never weighed upon me before, but today it is heavy.”
“You do not look tired at all, my lord,” replied Kanehira, “and your horse is still
fresh. What makes it feel so heavy? If it is because you are discouraged at having
none of your retainers but me, please remember that I, Kanehira, am a match for a
thousand. Since I still have seven or eight arrows left in my quiver, let me hold back
the foe while you withdraw to the Awazu pine wood. Now I pray you to put a
peaceful end to yourself.”
No sooner had he spoken to his master than another band of soldiers confronted
them. “Please go to the pine wood, my lord,” said Kanehira again. “Let me fight here
to keep them away from you.”
“I would have died in the capital!” replied Yoshinaka. “I have come this far with
no other hope but to share your fate. How can I die apart from you? Let us fight
until we die together!”
With these words, Yoshinaka tried to ride neck and neck with Kanehira. Now
Kanehira alighted from his horse, seized the bridle of his master’s mount, and
pleaded in tears: “Whatever fame a warrior may win, a worthless death is a lasting
shame for him. You are worn out, my lord. Your horse is also exhausted. If you are

surrounded by the enemy and slain at the hand of a low, worthless retainer of some
unknown warrior, it will be a great shame for you and me in the days to come. How
disgraceful it would be if such a nameless fellow could declare, ‘I cut off the head of
Yoshinaka, renowned throughout the land of Japan!”
From Hiroshi Kitagawa and Bruce T. Tsuchida, trans., The Tale of the Heike (Tokyo:
University of Tokyo Press, 1975), 520–23. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.
Yoshinaka finally gave in to Kanehira’s entreaty and rode off toward the pine
wood of Awazu. Kanehira, riding alone, charged into the band of some fifty
horsemen. Rising high in his stirrups, he cried out in a thunderous voice: “You have
often heard of me. Now take a good look. I am Imai no Shirō Kanehira, aged thirtythree, a foster brother of Lord Yoshinaka. As I am a valiant warrior among the men
of Lord Yoshinaka, your master, Yoritomo, at Kamakura must know my name well.
Take my head and show it to him!”
Kanehira had hardly uttered these words when he let fly his remaining eight
arrows one after another without pause. Eight men were shot from their horses,
either dead or wounded. He then drew his sword and brandished it as he galloped to
and fro. None of his opponents could challenge him face to face, though they cried
out: “Shoot him down! Shoot him down!”
Sanehira’s soldiers let fly a shower of arrows at Kanehira, but his armor was so
strong that none of them pierced it. Unless they aimed at the joints of his armor, he
could never be wounded.
Yoshinaka was now all alone in the pine wood of Awazu. It was the twenty-first
day of the first month. Dusk had begun to fall. Thin ice covered the rice fields and
the marsh, so that it was hard to distinguish one from the other. Thus it was that
Yoshinaka had not gone far before his horse plunged deep into the muddy slime.
Whipping and spurring no longer did any good. The horse could not stir. Despite his
predicament, he still thought of Kanehira. As Yoshinaka was turning around to see
how he fared, Tamehisa, catching up with him, shot an arrow under his helmet. It
was a mortal wound. Yoshinaka pitched forward onto the neck of his horse. Then
two of Tamehisa’s retainers fell upon Yoshinaka and struck off his head. Raising it
high on the point of his sword, Tamehisa shouted: “Kiso no Yoshinaka, renowned
throughout the land of Japan as a valiant warrior, has been killed by Miura no
Ishida Jirō Tamehisa!”
Kanehira was fighting desperately as these words rang in his ears. At that moment
he ceased fighting and cried out: “For whom do I have to fight now? You, warriors
of the east, see how the mightiest warrior in Japan puts an end to himself!”
Thrusting the point of his sword into his mouth, he flung himself headlong from his
horse so that the sword pierced his head.
Yoshinaka and Kanehira died valiant deaths at Awazu. Could there have been a
more heroic battle?
5. A Samurai Instructs His Son

… In dealing with subordinates do not make an obvious distinction between good
and not-good. Use the same kind of language, give the same kind of treatment to all,
and thus you will get the best out of the worst. But you yourself must not lose sight
of the distinction between good character and bad character, between capable and
incapable. You must be fair, but in practice you must not forget the difference
between men who are useful and men who are not. Remember that the key to
discipline is fair treatment in rewards and in punishments. But make allowance for

minor misdeeds in young soldiers and others, if their conduct is usually good.
Do not be careless or negligent in the presence of subordinates, especially of older
men. Thus do not spit or snuffle or lounge about on a chest with your legs dangling.
This only gives men the impression that you do not care for their good opinion.
Preserve your dignity. If you behave rudely, they will tell their families and gossip
will spread. You must treat all servants with proper consideration and generosity.…
Remember, however, that there are times when a commander must exercise his
power of deciding questions of life or death. In those circumstances since human life
is at stake you must give most careful thought to your action. Never kill or wound a
man in anger, however great the provocation. Better get somebody else to
administer the proper punishment. Decisions made in haste before your feelings are
calm can only lead to remorse. Close your eyes and reflect carefully when you have
a difficult decision to make.
When accusations are brought to you, always remember that there must be
another side to the question. Do not merely indulge in anger. To give fair decisions
is the most important thing not only in commanding soldiers but also in governing a
country.

CHAPTER 11
THE CRUSADES
Muslim and European Reactions
Increasing interactions among civilizations can work in many different ways. They
can promote mutual influence and imitation. But contact can also heighten mutual
hostilities or establish new enmities. This chapter deals with the clash between
Christians and Muslims during the Crusades. Enduring tension between Christian and
Muslim was not the only product of this episode, for the sources suggest other
consequences as well.
During the postclassical period, both religions spread widely. Islam was clearly
more successful, however, partly because it took root in a dynamic, politically and
commercially successful region. Often genuinely tolerant of Christians, whom
Muhammad had regarded as partially enlightened, Muslims nevertheless looked
down on Western Europe in this period as a backward, boorish place. Muslim
wealth, cities, science, and learning easily surpassed European levels, and Muslim
leaders were well aware of this fact.
For their part, Christians viewed Islam as an infidel, false religion, all the more
galling given Muslim success. There was far less tolerance in principle, and tension
was exacerbated by European awareness that Muslims surpassed them, during this
period, in economic and political achievements.
Christian crusades against Muslim control of the Holy Land (Jerusalem and its
environs) were first called for at the end of the eleventh century, at a point when the
Arab Caliphate was beginning to decline and Turks controlled considerable territory.
Feudal warriors from Western Europe volunteered to fight in the Middle East, for a
time carving out a Christian kingdom of Jerusalem. The Third Crusade, 1188–1192,
involving kings of England, France, and the Holy Roman Empire, responded to
successful Muslim attacks on Jerusalem, under the leadership of the great Turkish
warrior Saladin. This crusade led to negotiations that established temporary
Christian access to, though not control of, Jerusalem.
The Crusades provided unusual contacts between people, mainly warriors, of two
different cultures. Europeans learned much about the economically more advanced
Middle East, despite their deep hatred of Islam as a false religion and their frequent
attempt to portray Muslims as idol worshipers. Muslims formed or confirmed a
variety of opinions about Europeans. How much lasting impact did impressions of
this sort have?
Treatments of the same event—such as the Crusades—by people from opposite
sides have some fairly standard features. The other side commits atrocities, which
contrast with the purity and high aims of our side. Individual participants may
develop a grudging respect for the heroism or the simple humanity of opponents, a
respect that sometimes contradicts expressions of hatred.
But the accounts offer more than the “you’re another” type of mutual hostility.
The economic gap between the two sides is evident in comments about Muslim
luxury and European awe. To the extent that the Crusades confirmed not only some
dislike of European Christians but also a sense of their backwardness, they
contributed to a Muslim reluctance to pay attention to changes in Europe in

succeeding centuries that might have warranted greater openness.
The Crusades were an interesting episode in the postclassical period, not an
earthshaking event. They stemmed from significant cultural and other tensions, and
they unintentionally provided materials by which two important civilizations can be
compared. They also had some lasting, if largely unexpected, side effects in world
history later on, including increasing European interest in trade with Asia.
Intriguingly, contemporary Islamic extremists have revived the idea that the West is
engaged in a “crusade” against their religion, a sign that a historic conflict can
resurface in memory.
Questions
1. In what ways were Christian and Muslim accounts of the Crusades similar? In
what terms might each side praise the other?
2. How did the Christian account try to arouse sentiment against Muslim treatment
of the Christian religion? How did Muslim accounts try to arouse sentiment
against Christian mistreatment of or scorn for Islam?
3. What elements of Islam prompt Ibn-Mundiqh, in the final passage, to
simultaneously praise Christ and express shock at the idea of showing God as a
child? What clearly inaccurate reference to Islam is included in the Christian
account—and why would it have been included?
4. What references in the Muslim accounts particularly suggest a disdain for
European backwardness? What is the jealousy passage all about: given Muslim
(and Christian) views about men’s rights concerning women, why was this
probably a backhanded insult, designed to stimulate further disdain against
Christians?
5. As expressed in these accounts, were the reasons for Christian and Muslim dislike
of each other similar?
For Further Discussion
1. Which of the three accounts—all clearly partisan—strikes you as most accurate,
and why? (Or do they all seem equally biased?) Which reference, in any of the
accounts, seems most clearly distorted? What criteria help sort out accuracy when
the historical sources are clearly tainted?
2. How do the Crusades and Muslim and Christian accounts of them demonstrate
how these two religions resembled each other more than either one resembled
Buddhism, during the postclassical period?
3. What were the most important results of the Crusades?
A CHRISTIAN ACCOUNT
This account was written by Richard of the Holy Trinity, probably Richard de
Templo, who was later selected as Prior of the Holy Trinity but who served King
Richard as knight or chaplain during the Crusade. His account suggests not only
Christian views of Muslims but also key feudal military values (see chapter 9). The
subject of his biography, King Richard, known as the Lion-Hearted, won a huge
reputation in England as a noble warrior, even though (or because) he spent little
time at home (but he did spend considerable English revenues). King Richard fought
against his brothers and father and then in 1190 departed for the Third Crusade. His
attack on the city of Acre, in alliance with the King of France, failed, but he was
able to negotiate access to the holy places in Jerusalem with the Muslim leader

Saladin. He was captured and held for ransom on the way home and was later killed
in a war with France. Richard’s reputation as a brave and good king, enhanced by
accounts such as this, entered into other English legends such as that of Robin Hood,
and it contrasted with the image of his brother, later King John.
•••
THE CRUSADE OF RICHARD I

King Richard was not yet quite recovered from his illness; yet, anxious to be doing
something, he turned his thoughts to the capture of the city, and had it attacked by
his men in the hopes of gaining some success with God’s assistance. Accordingly he
had a kind of hurdle-shed (commonly called a circleia) made and brought up to the
ditch outside the city wall. Under its shelter were placed his most skilful
crossbowmen; whilst, to hearten his own men for the combat and to dispirit the
Saracens [Muslims] by his presence, he had himself carried there on silken cushions.
From this position he worked a crossbow, in the management of which he was very
skilful, and slew many of the foes by the bolts and quarrels he discharged. His
miners also, approaching the tower against which his stone-casters were being
levelled, by an underground passage dug down towards the foundations, filling the
gaps they made with logs of wood, to which they would set fire, thus causing the
walls, which had already been shaken by the stone-casters, to fall down with sudden
crash.
From T. A. Archer, ed., The Crusade of Richard I (New York: G. P. Putnam’s, 1885),
92–95, 97–98, 99, 101–2, 103, 126–27.
Thereupon the king, seeing how difficult the work was and how valiant were the
enemies, knowing also how needful it was to kindle men’s valour at critical
moments, thought it more fitting to encourage the young [warriors] on by promises
of reward than to urge them on by harsh words. For who is there whom the prospect
of gain will not entice? Accordingly he proclaimed that he would give two gold
pieces to any one who would detach a stone from the wall near the beforementioned tower. Later he promised three and even four gold-pieces for each stone.
Then might you see the young men with their followers leap forth and rush against
the wall and set themselves zealously to lugging out the stones—and this as much
for the sake of praise as of pay.… The height of the wall was very great and it was
of no slight thickness; yet, dispelling danger, by courage, they extracted many a
stone. The Turks rushing against [the assailants] in bands strove to cast them down
from the walls; and, while thus engaged in driving back their enemies, unwarily
exposed themselves to darts; for in their haste they rashly neglected to put on their
armour. One of the Turks who to his cost was glorying in the arms of Alberic
Clements, with which he had girded himself, did king Richard wound to death,
piercing him through the breast, with a dart from his crossbow. Grieving over the
death of this warrior the Turks recklessly rushed forward for vengeance, and, just as
though energetic action were a cure for pain, showed themselves so bold that it
seemed as if they feared neither darts nor any other missile. Never were our men
engaged by warriors—of any creed whatever—more valorous or apter at defence.
Memory staggers at the recollection of their deeds. In the press of this conflict
neither armour of strongest proof nor two-fold coat of mail nor quilted work was
strong enough to resist the missiles hurled from the stone-casters. Yet, for all this,
the Turks kept countermining from within till they compelled our men to retreat;
and then they began to raise a furious cry as though their object had been attained.
… At last the Pisans [Italians], eager for fame and vengeance, scrambled up the

tower itself with a mighty effort; but, bravely as they comported themselves, they
too had to retreat before the onset of the Turks, who rushed on as if mad. Never has
there been such a people as these Turks for prowess in war. And yet, for all the
enemies’ valour, the city would on that day have been taken and the whole siege
finished if the entire army had displayed an equal valour. For, you must know, by
far the larger part of the army was at that hour breakfasting; and, as the attack was
made at an unsuitable time, it did not succeed.
Though its walls were partly fallen and partly shaken, though a great part of the
inhabitants were slain or weakened by wounds, there still remained in the city 6,000
Turks.…
[Then leaders] imagined the Christian army had been very keenly touched at the
death of Alberic Clements and at the loss of sons and kinsmen who had fallen in the
war; and had determined to die or master the Turks—holding that no other course
was consistent with honour. So, by common consent and counsel, the besieged
begged a truce while they sent notice of their plight to Saladin, hoping that, in
accordance with their Pagan ways, he would ensure their safety—as he ought to do
—by sending them speedy aid or procuring leave for them to quit the city without
disgrace. To obtain this favour, these two noble Saracens, the most renowned
[warriors] in all Paganism, Mestoc and Caracois, came to our kings, promising to
surrender the city, if Saladin did not send them speedy aid. They stipulated,
however, that all the besieged Turks should have free leave to go wherever they
wished with their arms and all their goods. The king of France and almost all the
French agreed to this; but king Richard utterly refused to hear of entering an empty
city after so long and toilsome a siege.…
Meanwhile, the Christians’ stone-casters never ceased battering the walls night
and day. Seeing this a panic seized the inhabitants and some, in utter despair, giving
way to fear, threw themselves headlong from the walls by night. Many of them
humbly begged to be baptized and made Christians. There is considerable doubt as
to the real merits of these [converts], and not without due reason, since it is to be
presumed that it was terror rather than divine grace that caused them to make this
request. But the ways of salvation are many.…
Thus, on the Friday after the translation of the Blessed Benedict [i.e. July 12], the
wealthier and nobler emirs were proffered and accepted as hostages, one month
being allowed for the restoration of the Holy Cross and the collection of the captive
Christians. When the news of this surrender became known, the unthinking crowd
was moved with wrath; but the wiser folk were much rejoiced at getting so quickly
and without danger what previously they had not been able to obtain in so long a
time. Then the heralds made proclamation forbidding any one to insult the Turks by
word or deed. No missiles were to be hurled against the walls or against the Turks if
they chanced to appear on the battlements. On that day, when these famous Turks,
of such wonderful valour and warlike excellence, began strolling about on the city
walls in all their splendid apparel, previous to their departure [our men] gazed on
them with the utmost curiosity. They were wonder-struck at the cheerful features of
men who were leaving their city almost penniless and whom only the very sternest
necessity had driven to beg for mercy: men whom loss did not deject, and whose
visage betrayed no timidity, but even wore the look of victory. It was only their
superstitious rites and their pitiful idolatry that had robbed such warriors of their
strength.…
On the day of its surrender the city had been in the hands of the Saracens four

years. It was surrendered, as has been already said, on the morrow of the translation
of St. Benedict. But not without horror could the conquerors see the condition of the
churches within the city; nor can they even now remember the shameful sights they
witnessed there unmoved. What faithful Christian could, with tearless eyes, see the
holy features of the crucified Son of God, or even of the saints, dishonoured and
defiled? Who would not shudder when he actually saw the insulting way in which
the accursed Turks had overthrown the altars, torn down and battered the holy
crosses? Ay, and they had even set up their own images of Mahomet in the holy
places, introducing foul Mahommedan superstitions, after casting out all the
symbols of human redemption and the Christian religion.
MUSLIM ACCOUNTS
The first selection below was written by Bohadin or Beha-ed-Din, born at Mosul in
1145, a Muslim official of Jerusalem and later of Aleppo. He writes of the same
Crusade as did Richard of the Holy Trinity, referring to the kings of England and
France. The second account, dealing with a period earlier in the twelfth century,
comes from the memoirs of Usamah ibn-Munqidh as an Arab-Syrian warrior. He
writes of a time when the Christian crusaders controlled the city of Jerusalem;
European reactions to Muslim ways (and ibn-Munqidh’s reactions to the Europeans)
obviously varied from case to case, as often happens when war and occupation
combine with a certain familiarity.
•••
BEH-ED-DIN

The same day Hossâm ad-Din Ibn Barîc … brought news that the king of France had
set out for Tyre, and that they had come to talk over the matter of the prisoners and
to see the true cross of the Crucifixion if it were still in the Musulman [Muslim]
camp, or to ascertain if it really had been sent to Bagdad. It was shewn to them, and
on beholding it they shewed the profoundest reverence, throwing themselves on the
ground till they were covered with dust, and humbling themselves in token of
devotion. These envoys told us that the French princes had accepted the Sultan’s
proposition, viz., to deliver all that was specified in the treaty by three instalments
at intervals of a month. The Sultan then sent an envoy to Tyre with rich presents,
quantities of perfumes, and fine raiment—all of which were for the king of the
French.
From T. A. Archer, ed., The Crusade of Richard I (New York: G. P. Putnams, 1885),
127–31.
… Ibn Barîc and his comrades returned to the king of England while the Sultan
went off with his bodyguard and his closest friends to the hill that abuts on
Shefa’Amr.… Envoys did not cease to pass from one side to the other in the hope of
laying the foundation of a firm peace. These negotiations continued till our men had
procured the money and the tale of the prisoners that they were to deliver to the
French at the end of the first period in accordance with the treaty. The first
instalment was to consist of the Holy Cross, 100,000 dinars and 1,600 prisoners.
Trustworthy men sent by the Franks [French, or Europeans] to conduct the
examination found it all complete saving only the prisoners who had been
demanded by name, all of whom had not yet been gathered together. And thus the
negotiations continued to drag on till the end of the first term.…
This proposition the Sultan rejected, knowing full well that if he were to deliver

the money, the cross, and the prisoners, while our men were still kept captive by the
Franks, he would have no security against treachery on the part of the enemy, and
this would be a great disaster to Islam.
Then the king of England, seeing all the delays interposed by the Sultan to the
execution of the treaty, acted perfidiously as regards his Musulman prisoners. On
their yielding the town he had engaged to grant them life, adding that if the Sultan
carried out the bargain he would give them freedom and suffer them to carry off
their children and wives; if the Sultan did not fulfil his engagements they were to be
made slaves. Now the king broke his promises to them and made open display of
what he had till now kept hidden in his heart, by carrying out what he had intended
to do after he had received the money and the Frank prisoners. It is thus that people
of his nation ultimately admitted.
In the afternoon of Tuesday… about four o’clock, he came out on horseback with
all the Frankish army. … The Franks, on reaching the middle of the plain that
stretches between this hill and that of Keisân, close to which place the sultan’s
advanced guard had drawn back, ordered all the Musulman prisoners, whose
martyrdom God had decreed for this day, to be brought before him. They numbered
more than three thousand and were all bound with ropes. The Franks then flung
themselves upon them all at once and massacred them with sword and lance in cold
blood. Our advanced guard had already told the Sultan of the enemy’s movements
and he sent it some reinforcements, but only after the massacre. The Musulmans,
seeing what was being done to the prisoners, rushed against the Franks and in the
combat, which lasted till nightfall, several were slain and wounded on either side.
On the morrow morning our people gathered at the spot and found the Musulmans
stretched out upon the ground as martyrs for the faith. They even recognised some
of the dead, and the sight was a great affliction to them. The enemy had only spared
the prisoners of note and such as were strong enough to work.
The motives of this massacre are differently told; according to some, the captives
were slain by way of reprisal for the death of those Christians whom the Musulmans
had slain. Others again say that the king of England, on deciding to attempt the
conquest of Ascalon, thought it unwise to leave so many prisoners in the town after
his departure. God alone knows what the real reason was.
USAMAH IBN-MUNQIDH

… A case illustrating their [the Europeans’] curious medicine is the following:
The lord of al-Munaytirah wrote to my uncle asking him to dispatch a physician
to treat certain sick persons among his people. My uncle sent him a Christian
physician named Thābit. Thābit was absent but ten days when he returned. So we
said to him, “How quickly hast thou healed thy patients!” He said:
They brought before me a knight in whose leg an abscess had grown; and a
woman afflicted with imbecility. To the knight I applied a small poultice
until the abscess opened and became well; and the woman I put on diet and
made her humor wet. Then a Frankish physician came to them and said,
“This man knows nothing about treating them.” He then said to the knight,
“Which wouldst thou prefer, living with one leg or dying with two?” The
latter replied, “Living with one leg.” The physician said, “Bring me a strong
knight and a sharp ax.” A knight came with the ax. And I was standing by.
Then the physician laid the leg of the patient on a block of wood and bade
the knight strike his leg with the ax and chop it off at one blow. Accordingly

he struck it—while I was looking on—one blow, but the leg was not severed.
He dealt another blow, upon which the marrow of the leg flowed out and
the patient died on the spot. He then examined the woman and said, “This is
a woman in whose head there is a devil which has possessed her. Shave off
her hair.” Accordingly they shaved it off and the woman began once more to
eat their ordinary diet—garlic and mustard. Her imbecility took a turn for
the worse. The physician then said, “The devil has penetrated through her
head.” He therefore took a razor, made a deep cruciform incision on it,
peeled off the skin at the middle of the incision until the bone of the skull
was exposed and rubbed it with salt. The woman also expired instantly.
Thereupon I asked them whether my services were needed any longer, and
when they replied in the negative I returned home, having learned of their
medicine what I knew not before.
From Usamah ibn-Munqidh, Memoirs: An Arab-Syrian Gentleman and Warrior in the
Period of the Crusades, ed. Philip Hitti, (Princeton, N. J.: Princeton University Press,
1987), 67–68, 70, 162–65. Copyright © Viola Winder.
I have, however, witnessed a case of their medicine which was quite different
from that.
The king of the Franks had for treasurer a knight named Bernard [barnād], who
(may Allah’s curse be upon him!) was one of the most accursed and wicked among
the Franks. A horse kicked him in the leg, which was subsequently infected and
which opened in fourteen different places. Every time one of these cuts would close
in one place, another would open in another place. All this happened while I was
praying for his perdition. Then came to him a Frankish physician and removed from
the leg all the ointments which were on it and began to wash it with very strong
vinegar. By this treatment all the cuts were healed and the man became well again.
He was up again like a devil.…
Newly arrived Franks are especially rough: One insists that Usāmah should pray
eastward.—Everyone who is a fresh emigrant from the Frankish lands is ruder in
character than those who have become acclimatized and have held long association
with the Moslems. Here is an illustration of their rude character.
Whenever I visited Jerusalem I always entered the Aq a Mosque, beside which
stood a small mosque which the Franks had converted into a church. When I used to
enter the Aq a Mosque, which was occupied by the Templars [al-dāwiyyah], who
were my friends, the Templars would evacuate the little adjoining mosque so that I
might pray in it. One day I entered this mosque, repeated the first formula, “Allah is
great,” and stood up in the act of praying, upon which one of the Franks rushed on
me, got hold of me and turned my face eastward saying, “This is the way thou
shouldst pray!” A group of Templars hastened to him, seized him and repelled him
from me. I resumed my prayer. The same man, while the others were otherwise
busy, rushed once more on me and turned my face eastward, saying, “This is the way
thou shouldst pray!” The Templars again came in to him and expelled him. They
apologized to me, saying, “This is a stranger who has only recently arrived from the
land of the Franks and he has never before seen anyone praying except eastward.”
Thereupon I said to myself, “I have had enough prayer.” So I went out and have ever
been surprised at the conduct of this devil of a man, at the change in the color of his
face, his trembling and his sentiment at the sight of one praying towards the qiblah
[direction of Mecca].
Another wants to show to a Moslem God as a child.—I saw one of the Franks

come to al-Amīr Mu‘īn-al-Dī (may Allah’s mercy rest upon his soul!) when he was in
the Dome of the Rock and say to him, “Dost thou want to see God as a child?”
Mu‘¯n-al-Dīn said, “Yes.” The Frank walked ahead of us until he showed us the
picture of Mary with Christ (may peace be upon him!) as an infant in her lap. He
then said, “This is God as a child.” But Allah is exalted far above what the infidels
say about him!
The Franks are void of all zeal and jealousy. One of them may be walking along
with his wife. He meets another man who takes the wife by the hand and steps aside
to converse with her while the husband is standing on one side waiting for his wife
to conclude the conversation. If she lingers too long for him, he leaves her alone
with the conversant and goes away.
Here is an illustration which I myself witnessed:
When I used to visit Nāblus, I always took lodging with a man named Mu‘izz,
whose home was a lodging house for the Moslems. The house had windows which
opened to the road, and there stood opposite to it on the other side of the road a
house belonging to a Frank who sold wine for the merchants. He would take some
wine in a bottle and go around announcing it by shouting, “So and so, the merchant,
has just opened a cask full of this wine. He who wants to buy some of it will find it
in such and such a place.” The Frank’s pay for the announcement made would be the
wine in that bottle. One day this Frank went home and found a man with his wife in
the same bed. He asked him, “What could have made thee enter into my wife’s
room?” The man replied, “I was tired, so I went in to rest.” “But how,” asked he,
“didst thou get into my bed?” The other replied, “I found a bed that was spread, so I
slept in it.” “But,” said he, “my wife was sleeping together with thee!” The other
replied, “Well, the bed is hers. How could I therefore have prevented her from using
her own bed?” “By the truth of my religion,” said the husband, “if thou shouldst do
it again, thou and I would have a quarrel.” Such was for the Frank the entire
expression of his disapproval and the limit of his jealousy.

CHAPTER 12
MERCHANTS AND TRADE
The postclassical period witnessed an important expansion of trade, within many
civilizations and across their fluid boundaries. Merchants gained a growing role in
West Africa, throughout the Islamic world, in Europe (both east and west), and in
East Asia. Many traded locally, though international merchants made the biggest
impression. Chinese commercial centers grew rapidly, supporting a more urban
environment. At the same time, many societies had reservations about merchants.
Aristocrats worried about their social claims, rulers might envy their wealth, priests
and philosophers questioned their motives. The clash of cultures, between religion
and materialism, was particularly intense because of the complex new forces at
work in these centuries. A genuine ambivalence about merchants was common
throughout the postclassical world—and it could affect merchants themselves, as
well as how they were treated.
This chapter deals with trade and its cultural impacts. It provides another set of
comparisons among three trading societies and also a chance to deal with change
during the period itself.
The description of the twelfth-century British merchant Godric was written by a
biographer attracted to his saintly life (most merchants did not, it should be
emphasized, become saints). It suggests both actual activities and cultural values.
The Muslim description of merchants’ vices and merits comes from the great
historian and philosopher Ibn Khaldun, a North African who wrote in the fourteenth
century. The Chinese essay on merchants was written by Chang Han, early in the
sixteenth century (right after the postclassical period and more than a half-century
after the Ming dynasty had ended its most vigorous international trade). Chang Han
was a Ming official whose family had made a fortune in the textile industry, which
helps explain the combination of Confucian and reformist remarks.
Questions
1. What kinds of uneasiness did Muslim observers have about trade? In what way
did they support trade?
2. How did Chinese concerns about merchant motives differ from those of
Christianity?
3. How did Islam offer a distinctive combination of trade and cultural goals—this
one more favorable to trade without slighting religion? In what ways did Islam
and Christianity, such similar religions in many respects, differ over the validity of
trade; would a Godric story have been probable in Islam?
4. What exceptions or ambiguities do the sources suggest, even as they emphasize
high ideals? What kinds of activities in Europe clearly represented crasser motives
than those of a holy merchant like Godric? Why, in fact, did Godric not enter a
holy calling initially—what kinds of motives drew him to trade?
5. How could merchant activity increase within China—as it did in the postclassical
period, as cities and business houses prospered—within an official Confucian
framework? How did the Confucian bureaucracy collaborate?
6. Do the sources suggest that Europe was becoming wealthier than China by the late
postclassical period?

For Further Discussion
1. In light of the postclassical sources and comparisons, how would you rate the
argument that no matter what their professed values, most people and societies
are motivated by a desire for profit and will expand commercially whenever they
can? Is a desire for economic gain an inherent part of human nature?
2. Which came first in world history: concern about trade or economic limitations?
Did Christianity cause Western Europe’s initial commercial lag in the postclassical
period, or did economic decline encourage Christian concerns? How did
Confucianism affect actual Chinese economic patterns in the post-classical period
and beyond?
3. How do postclassical discussions of trade and merchants compare with the
discussions probable in the modern world?
A MUSLIM VIEW: IBN KHALDUN
Ibn Khaldun was one of the greatest historians and geographers of all time. Born in
Tunis, North Africa, he lived from 1332 to 1406. He served as an official in Tunis,
Morocco, and Spain and traveled widely, finally settling, as a scholar, in Egypt. His
great work was the Kitab al-Ibar (universal history), which included comments on
the active trade that he saw around him, at the time when Muslim commercial
success was still near its height.
•••
CHARACTERISTICS OF TRADERS

Commerce, as we have said before, is the increasing of capital by buying goods and
attempting to sell them at a price higher than their cost. This is done either by
waiting for a rise in the market price; or by transporting the goods to another place
where they are more keenly demanded and therefore fetch a higher price; or, lastly,
by selling them on a long-term credit basis. Commercial profit is small, relatively to
the capital invested, but if the capital is large, even a low rate of profit will produce
a large total gain.
In order to achieve this increase in capital, it is necessary to have enough initial
capital to pay in cash the sellers from whom one buys goods; it is also necessary to
sell for cash, as honesty is not widespread among people. This dishonesty leads on
the one hand to fraud and the adulteration of goods, and on the other to delays in
payment which diminish profits because capital remains idle during the interval. It
also induces buyers to repudiate their debts, a practice which is very injurious to the
merchant’s capital unless he can produce documentary evidence or the testimony of
eyewitness. Nor are magistrates of much help in such cases, because they necessarily
judge on evident proofs.
As a result of all this, the trader can only secure his meagre profits by dint of
much effort and toil, or indeed he may well lose not only profits but capital as well.
Hence, if he is known to be bold in entering law suits, careful in keeping accounts,
stubborn in defending his point of view, firm in his attitude towards magistrates, he
stands a good chance of getting his due. Should he not have these qualities, his only
chance is to secure the support of a highly placed protector who will awe his debtors
into paying him and the magistrates into meting justice out to him. Thus he gets
justice spontaneously in the first case, and by compulsion in the second. Should a
person, however, be lacking in boldness and the spirit of enterprise and at the same

time have no protector to back him up, he had better avoid trade altogether, as he
risks losing his capital and becoming the prey of other merchants. The fact of the
matter is that most people, especially the mob and the trading classes, covet the
goods of others; and but for the restraint imposed by the magistrates all goods
would have been taken away from their owners.…
The manners of tradesmen are inferior to those of rulers, and far removed from
manliness and uprightness. We have already stated that traders must buy and sell
and seek profits. This necessitates flattery, and evasiveness, litigation and
disputation, all of which are characteristic of this profession. And these qualities
lead to a decrease and weakening in virtue and manliness. For acts inevitably affect
the soul; thus good acts produce good and virtuous effects in the soul while evil or
mean acts produce the opposite. Hence the effects of evil acts will strike root and
strengthen themselves, if they should come early in life and repeat themselves; while
if they come later they will efface the virtues by imprinting their evil effects on the
soul; as is the case with all habits resulting from actions.

These effects will differ according to the conditions of the traders. For those of
them who are of mean condition and in direct contact with the cheating and
extortion of sellers will be more affected by these evils and further removed from
manliness.… The other kind of traders are those who are protected by prestige and
do not have to undertake directly such operations. Such persons are very rare indeed
and consist of those who have acquired wealth suddenly, by inheritance or by other,
unusual means. This wealth enables them to get in touch with the rulers and thus to
gain prestige and protection so that they are released from practising these things
[viz. buying and selling] themselves; instead, they entrust such business to their
agents. Moreover the rulers, who are not indifferent to the wealth and liberality of
such traders, protect them in their right and thus free them from certain unpleasant
actions and their resulting evil effects. Hence they will be more manly and
honourable than the other kind of trader; yet certain effects will still make
themselves felt behind the veil, inasmuch as they still have to supervise their agents
and employees in their doings—but this only takes place to a limited extent and its
effects are hardly visible.…
… Consider, as an example, the lands of the East, such as Egypt, Syria, Persia,
India, or China; or the lands lying North of the Mediterranean. Because social life is
flourishing there, notice how wealth has increased, the state has grown stronger,
towns have multiplied, trade has prospected prospered, conditions have improved.…
As for Trade, although it be a natural means of livelihood, yet most of the
methods it employs are tricks aimed at making a profit by securing the difference
between the buying and selling prices, and by appropriating the surplus. This is why
[religious] Law allows the use of such methods, which, although they come under
the heading of gambling, yet do not constitute the taking without return of other
people’s goods.…
Should their standard of living, however, rise, so that they begin to enjoy more
than the bare necessities, the effect will be to breed in them a desire for repose and
tranquillity. They will therefore co-operate to secure superfluities; their food and
clothing will increase in quantity and refinement; they will enlarge their houses and

plan their towns for defence. A further improvement in their conditions will lead to
habits of luxury, resulting in extreme refinement in cooking and the preparation of
food; in choosing rich clothing of the finest silk; in raising lofty mansions and castles
and furnishing them luxuriously, and so on. At this stage the crafts develop and
reach their height. Lofty castles and mansions are built and decorated sumptuously,
water is drawn to them and a great diversity takes place in the way of dress,
furniture, vessels, and household equipment.
Such are the townsmen, who earn their living in industry or trade. Their gains are
greater than those working in agriculture or animal husbandry and their standard of
living higher, being in line with their wealth. We have shown, then, that both the
nomadic and the urban stages are natural and necessary.
A CHRISTIAN VIEW: REGINALD OF DURHAM ON SAINT GODRIC
This excerpt from a biography of Godric, an English merchant who later became a
saint, both describes actual merchant activities in Europe and provides an example
of an established literary-religious form of writing in Christian Europe in which the
main point was to stress the saint’s virtues and use biography as an inspiration to
others. There may be some distortion of reality here; certainly, some aspects of the
merchant condition have to be discovered by reading between the lines.

This holy man’s father was named Ailward, and his mother Edwenna; both of
slender rank and wealth, but abundant in righteousness and virtue. … When the boy
had passed his childish years quietly at home; then, as he began to grow to
manhood, he began to follow more prudent ways of life, and to learn carefully and
persistently the teachings of worldly forethought. Wherefore he chose not to follow
the life of a husbandman, but rather to study, learn and exercise the rudiment of
more subtle conceptions. For this reason, aspiring to the merchant’s trade, he began
to follow the chapman’s [peddler’s] way of life, first learning how to gain in small
bargains and things of insignificant price; and thence, while yet a youth, his mind
advanced little by little to buy and sell and gain from things of greater expense. For,
in his beginnings, he was wont to wander with small wares around the villages and
farmsteads of his own neighborhood; but, in process of time, he gradually associated
himself by compact with city merchants. Hence, within a brief space of time, the
youth who had trudged for many weary hours from village to village, from farm to
farm, did so profit by his increase of age and wisdom as to travel with associates of
his own age through towns and boroughs fortresses and cities, to fairs and to all the
various booths of the market-place.… He went along the high-way, neither puffed up
by the good testimony of his conscience nor downcast in the nobler part of his soul
by the reproach of poverty.…

Britain from the Conquest to the Reformation (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1918), 415–20. Reprinted with the permission of Cambridge University Press.
Yet in all things he walked with simplicity; and, in so far as he yet knew how, it
was ever his pleasure to follow in the footsteps of the truth. For, having learned the
Lord’s Prayer and the Creed from his very cradle, he oftentimes turned them over in
his mind, even as he went alone on his longer journeys; and, in so far as the truth
was revealed to his mind, he clung thereunto most devoutly in all his thoughts
concerning God. At first, he lived as a [salesman] for four years in Lincolnshire,
going on foot and carrying the smallest wares; then he travelled abroad, first to St

Andrews in Scotland and then for the first time to Rome. On his return, having
formed a familiar friendship with certain other young men who were eager for
merchandise, he began to launch upon bolder courses, and to coast frequently by sea
to the foreign lands that lay around him. Thus, sailing often to and fro between
Scotland and Britain, he traded in many divers wares and, amid these occupations,
learned much worldly wisdom. … He fell into many perils of the sea, yet by God’s
mercy he was never wrecked; for He who had upheld St Peter as he walked upon the
waves, by that same strong right arm kept this His chosen vessel from all misfortune
amid these perils. Thus, having learned by frequent experience his wretchedness
amid such dangers, he began to worship certain of the Saints with more ardent zeal,
venerating and calling upon their shrines, and giving himself up by wholehearted
service to those holy names. In such invocations his prayers were oftentimes
answered by prompt consolation; some of which prayers he learned from his fellows
with whom he shared these frequent perils; others he collected from faithful hearsay;
others again from the custom of the place, for he saw and visited such holy places
with frequent assiduity. Thus aspiring ever higher and higher, and yearning upward
with his whole heart, at length his great labours and cares bore much fruit of
worldly gain. For he laboured not only as a merchant but also as a shipman… to
Denmark and Flanders and Scotland; in all which lands he found certain rare, and
therefore more precious, wares, which he carried to other parts wherein he knew
them to be least familiar, and coveted by the inhabitants beyond the price of gold
itself; wherefore he exchanged these wares for others coveted by men of other lands.
… Hence he made great profit in all his bargains, and gathered much wealth in the
sweat of his brow; for he sold dear in one place the wares which he had bought
elsewhere at a small price.
Then he purchased the half of a merchant-ship with certain of his partners in the
trade; and again by his prudence he bought the fourth part of another ship. At
length, by his skill in navigation, wherein he excelled all his fellows, he earned
promotion to the post of steersman.…
[On his travels] he oftentimes touched at the island of Lindisfarne, wherein St
Cuthbert had been bishop, and at the isle of Farne, where that Saint had lived as an
anchoret, and where St Godric (as he himself would tell afterwards) would meditate
on the Saint’s life with abundant tears. Thence he began to yearn for solitude, and to
hold his merchandise in less esteem than heretofore.…
And now he had lived sixteen years as a merchant, and began to think of spending
on charity, to God’s honour and service, the goods which he had so laboriously
acquired. He therefore took the cross as a pilgrim to Jerusalem, and, having visited
the Holy Sepulchre, came back to England by way of St James [of Compostella]. Not
long afterwards he became steward to a certain rich man of his own country, with
the care of his whole house and household. But certain of the younger household
were men of iniquity, who stole their neighbours’ cattle and thus held luxurious
feasts, whereat Godric, in his ignorance, was sometimes present. Afterwards,
discovering the truth, he rebuked and admonished them to cease; but they made no
account of his warnings; wherefore he concealed not their iniquity, but disclosed it
to the lord of the household, who, however, slighted his advice. Wherefore he
begged to be dismissed and went on a pilgrimage, first to St Gilles and thence to
Rome the abode of the Apostles, that thus he might knowingly pay the penalty for
those misdeeds wherein he had ignorantly partaken. I have often seen him, even in
his old age, weeping for this unknowing transgression.…
On his return from Rome, he abode awhile in his father’s house; until, inflamed

again with holy zeal, he purposed to revisit the abode of the Apostles and made his
desire known unto his parents. Not only did they approve his purpose, but his
mother besought his leave to bear him company on this pilgrimage; which he gladly
granted, and willingly paid her every filial service that was her due. They came
therefore to London; and they had scarcely departed from thence when his mother
took off her shoes, going thus barefooted to Rome and back to London. Godric,
humbly serving his parent, was wont to bear her on his shoulders.…
Godric, when he had restored his mother safe to his father’s arms, abode but a
brief while at home; for he was now already firmly purposed to give himself entirely
to God’s service. Wherefore, that he might follow Christ the more freely, he sold all
his possessions and distributed them among the poor. Then, telling his parents of
this purpose and receiving their blessing, he went forth to no certain abode, but
whithersoever the Lord should deign to lead him; for above all things he coveted the
life of a hermit.
A CHINESE VIEW: CHANG HAN
This passage was written early in the sixteenth century, right after the postclassical
period and more than a half-century after the Ming dynasty had stopped its
international trade expeditions. Of the three authors in this chapter, Chang Han
came the closest to having merchant experience of his own. He came from a family
that had made a fortune in the textile industry, but he himself was sent to Confucian
schools and became an official in the Ming dynasty. His background helps explain
the combination of Confucian and reformist remarks.

ESSAY ON MERCHANTS

Money and profit are of great importance to men. They seek profit, then suffer by it,
yet they cannot forget it. They exhaust their bodies and spirits, run day and night,
yet they still regard what they have gained as insufficient.…
Those who become merchants eat fine food and wear elegant clothes. They ride
on beautifully caparisoned, double-harnessed horses—dust flying as they race
through the streets and the horses’ precious sweat falling like rain. Opportunistic
persons attracted by their wealth offer to serve them. Pretty girls in beautiful longsleeved dresses and delicate slippers play string and wind instruments for them and
compete to please them.
Merchants boast that their wisdom and ability are such as to give them a free
hand in affairs. They believe that they know all the possible transformations in the
universe and therefore can calculate all the changes in the human world, and that
the rise and fall of prices are under their command. They are confident that they
will not make one mistake in a hundred in their calculations. These merchants do
not know how insignificant their wisdom and ability really are. As the Chuang Tzu
says: “Great understanding is broad and unhurried; little understanding is cramped
and busy.”
Because I have traveled to many places during my career as an official, I am

familiar with commercial activities and business conditions in various places. The
capital is located in an area with mountains at its back and a great plain stretching
in front. The region is rich in millet, grain, donkeys, horses, fruit, and vegetables,
and has become a center where goods from distant places are brought. Those who
engage in commerce, including the foot peddler, the cart peddler, and the
shopkeeper, display not only clothing and fresh foods from the fields but also
numerous luxury items such as priceless jade from K’un-lun, pearls from the island
of Hai-nan, gold from Yunnan, and coral from Vietnam. These precious items,
coming from the mountains or the sea, are not found in central China. But people in
remote areas and in other countries, unafraid of the dangers and difficulties of
travel, transport these items step by step to the capital, making it the most
prosperous place in the empire.…
Profits from selling tea and the officials’ income from the tea tax are usually ten
to twenty percent of the original investment. By contrast, merchants’ profits from
selling salt and the officials’ income from the salt tax can reach seventy to eighty
percent of the original invested capital. In either case, the more the invested capital,
the greater the profit; the less the invested capital, the less the profit. The profits
from selling tea and salt enrich the nation as well as the merchants. Skillful
merchants can make great profits for themselves while the inept ones suffer losses.
This is the present state of the tea and salt business.
In our Chekiang province it appears that most of the rich gain their wealth from
engaging in salt trade. But the Chia family in Wu-ling became rich from selling tea
and have sustained their prosperity for generations. The “Book of Chou” [one of the
oldest classics] says: “If farmers do not work, there will be an insufficiency of food;
if craftsmen do not work, there will be an insufficiency of tools; if merchants do not
work, circulation of the three necessities will be cut off, which will cause food and
materials to be insufficient.”
Foreigners [in the Northwest] are recalcitrant and their greed knows no bounds.
At the present time our nation spends over one million cash yearly from our treasury
on these foreigners, still we cannot rid ourselves of their demands. What is more, the
greedy heart is unpredictable. If one day they break the treaties and invade our
frontiers, who will be able to defend us against them? I do not think our present
trade with them will ensure us a century of peace.
As to the foreigners in the Southeast, their goods are useful to us just as ours are
to them. To use what one has to exchange for what one does not have is what trade
is all about. Moreover, these foreigners trade with China under the name of tributary
contributions. That means China’s authority is established and the foreigners are
submissive. Even if the gifts we grant them are great and the tribute they send us is
small, our expense is still less than one ten-thousandth of the benefit we gain from
trading with them. Moreover, the Southeast sea foreigners are more concerned with
trading with China than with gaining gifts from China. Even if they send a large
tribute offering only to receive small gifts in return, they will still be content. In
addition, trading with them can enrich our people. So why do we refrain from the
trade?
Some people may say that the Southeast sea foreigners have invaded us several
times so they are not the kind of people with whom we should trade. But they
should realize that the Southeast sea foreigners need Chinese goods and the Chinese
need their goods. If we prohibit the natural flow of this merchandise, how can we
prevent them from invading us? I believe that if the sea trade were opened, the

trouble with foreign pirates would cease. These Southeast sea foreigners are simple
people, not to be compared to the unpredictable Northeast sea foreigners. Moreover,
China’s exports in the Northwest trade come from the national treasury. Whereas the
Northwest foreign trade ensures only harm, the sea trade provides us with only gain.
How could those in charge of the government fail to realize this?
Turning to the taxes levied on Chinese merchants, though these taxes are needed
to fill the national treasury, excessive exploitation should be prohibited. Merchants
from all areas are ordered to stop their carts and boats and have their bags and
cases examined whenever they pass through a road or river checkpoint. Often the
cargoes are overestimated and thus a falsely high duty is demanded. Usually
merchants are taxed when they enter the checkpoint and are taxed again at the
marketplace. When a piece of goods is taxed once, the merchant can still make some
profit while complying with the state’s regulations. But today’s merchants often are
stopped on the road for additional payments and also suffer extortions from the
clerks. Such exploitation is hard and bitter enough but, in addition, the merchants
are taxed twice. How can they avoid becoming more and more impoverished?
When I was Vice-President of the Board of Public Works in Nanking, I was also in
charge of the customs duties on the upper and lower streams of the Black Dragon
River. At that time I was working with Imperial Censor Fang K’o-yung. I told him:
“In antiquity, taxes on merchants were in the form of voluntary contributions based
on official hints, not through levies. Levying taxes on merchants is a bad policy. We
should tax people according to their degree of wealth or poverty. Who says we
cannot have good government!” Fang agreed with me, so we lowered the taxes on
the merchants some twenty percent. After the taxes were lowered, merchants
became willing to stop at the checkpoints. All boats stopped when they should and
the total tax income received from merchants increased fifty percent. From this
example one can see that the people can be moved by benevolent policies.

CHAPTER 13
THE MONGOL ERA
Conquests and Connections
This chapter compares the experiences of China, Russia, and Western Europe during
the period of the Mongol conquests in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The
development of interlocking Mongol empires, called khanates, produced significant
but diverse consequences in world history. Coming on the heels of the decline of
Arab world power, the Mongol episode facilitated vital exchanges among previously
separate civilizations while producing new tensions in large parts of Asia and
Eastern Europe.
The Mongols, a herding people from Central Asia, gained important leadership
structure and cultural values from interacting with more formal civilizations such as
China. Contacts along China’s northern border increased for several centuries. New
leadership, and possibly some population pressure, inspired a wave of military
ventures in the thirteenth century under the aegis of Chinggis Khan. The Mongols
swept through the empire of China from 1206 onward and controlled the society for
over a century. They pushed into the Middle East, toppling the Arab caliphate and
challenging Turkish forces, and into Southeast Asia. They also conquered Russia
(1236), which they loosely controlled for almost two centuries. Mongol victories in
Poland and Hungary did not lead to durable conquests in the rest of Europe. Two
efforts to conquer Japan also failed, leading to a growing sense of confidence and
isolation there. Even the consequences of failure, however, reveal the awesome
sweep of Mongol power.
Overall, the Mongol era in world history had two results: it caused disruption and
resentment, and it provided unusual, stimulating international contacts.
Mongol overlords were resented in most of their holdings, despite efforts by
individual rulers, such as the famous Kublai Khan in China, to adapt to established
political and cultural traditions. Although some Chinese officials assisted the
Mongols in return for specific gains, such as the preservation of Chinese unity, there
were many points of discord. Confucianists believed that the Mongols scorned their
commitment to bureaucracy and hierarchy. Kublai Khan praised Confucianism on
occasion, but he utilized non-Confucian officials and, along with other leaders,
increasingly inclined to the Buddhist religion, which Chinese officialdom had
previously rejected.
The Russian situation was somewhat different. The resentment was strong here,
too, in part because Mongol leaders concentrated on military coercion and demands
for taxes and tribute, rather than the more systematic government developed in
China. The cultural clash was different but severe, for Russia was committed to
Orthodox Christianity, and its religious leaders condemned the Mongols as pagans,
possibly a punitive visitation from God.
If the Mongol period meant resentment and disruption in key civilizations, it
meant new opportunity for other peoples. Many Muslims appreciated trade
opportunities with Mongol China and reported their awe at the wealth of the leading
cities. Western Europeans responded even more eagerly, despite criticism of the
Mongol commitment to “pagan” religions. Since Europe was spared any direct
Mongol invasions, European religious and commercial leaders took advantage of

Mongol tolerance of foreign travelers and trading activities. Direct European
contacts with China were established for the first time in world history, and as a
result the Europeans gained access to China’s superior technology. European appetite
for trade with Asia, already encouraged by the Crusades (see chapter 9), increased as
well.
The Mongol era, decisive in Eurasian history toward the end of the post-classical
millennium, was also brief. China regained independence, with its new Ming
dynasty, in 1328. Russia won increasing autonomy by the late fourteenth century, an
effort spearheaded by the dukes of the Moscow region, and then attained full
autonomy around 1450, pushing the Mongol overlords farther and farther back into
central Asia. With these changes, the period of easy Western contact with East Asia
ended as well. But after the Mongol period, the Eurasian civilizations did not return
to the previous status quo. The diverse results of the Mongol experience continued to
affect policies of expansion and isolation, and the heady period of technological
exchange continued to be exploited.
Questions
1. What characteristics did even sympathetic Chinese observers assign to the
Mongols? Why was it easy to look down on Mongol habits despite the Mongols’
success in conquest?
2. What does the Mongol description of the conquest of China suggest about
probable Chinese reactions?
3. What does the Novgorod Chronicle suggest about Russia’s cultural levels and
social unity as it encountered Mongol pressures?
4. What was Novgorod’s reaction to the Tartars (Mongols)? How did Russian
religious authorities describe Tartar characteristics? How did their reactions
compare with those of the Chinese?
5. How did Novgorod actually deal with the Tartars? Judging by this city’s
experience, what were the major impacts of the Mongol invasion on postclassical
Russia? Did the Mongols cause or rather reflect the Russian disarray?
6. How did the Mongol approach to Russia differ from Kublai Khan’s efforts in
China? What did the Mongols want in each case? What might explain the
differences in goals?
7. How did the Russian experience with the Mongols compare with that of China?
Which society was more disrupted, and why?
8. How did Marco Polo try to appeal both to critical and to envious impressions of
Mongol rulers? Why would both reactions seem appropriate to a Western
European audience?
9. How did Marco Polo’s reactions explain why Western Europe was ready to gain
from the new contacts with East Asia? Why did Russia not develop a similar set of
contacts?
For Further Discussion
1. How did the Mongol experience affect later Russian policies: what might be
predicted about later interests in expansion and about later attitudes toward Asia?
2. What were the long-term consequences of the Mongol experience in China? How
and why did Russia’s and China’s “post-Mongol” policies diverge?
3. Why was the Mongol era important for Western Europe? How did Marco Polo’s

account compare with earlier European reactions to cultural contact, as suggested
by previous travelers and by the tales of the Crusades? What kinds of
misperceptions still accompanied Western beliefs about societies such as China,
and why?
MONGOLS IN CHINA: LI CHIH-CH’ANG AND THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE
MONGOLS
The first of the following selections is a Taoist emissary’s impressions of the Mongols
under Chinggis Khan, as the Mongol invasion of China began. Li Chih-Ch’ang,
accompanying a Taoist master summoned by the khan into central Asia, had
favorable discussions with the khan, who professed interest in the religion. Li’s view,
correspondingly, was less jaded than that of Confucian officials later on. But even
these Chinese certainly saw the Mongols as very different: how did their reactions
predict wider Chinese distaste for Mongol rule? The second selection is by an
unknown author, perhaps someone in Chinggis’s household writing about his
conquests shortly after his death. The account was called The Secret History of the
Mongols.

LI CHIH-CH’ANG

The people live in black waggons and white tents; they are all herdsmen and
hunters. Their clothes are made of hides and fur; they live on meat and curdled milk.
The men wear their hair in two plaits that hang behind the ears. The married women
wear a head-dress of birch-bark, some two feet high. This they generally cover with
a black woollen stuff; but some of the richer women use red silk. The end (of this
head-dress) is like a duck; they call it ku-ku. They are in constant fear of people
knocking against it, and are obliged to go backwards and crouching through the
doorways of their tents.
They have no writing. Contracts are either verbal or recorded by tokens carved
out of wood. Whatever food they get is shared among them, and if any one is in
trouble the others hasten to his assistance. They are obedient to orders and unfailing
in their performance of a promise. They have indeed preserved the simplicity of
primeval times.…
Both men and women plait their hair. The men’s hats are often like yüan-shanmao
[theatrical caps], trimmed with all kinds of coloured stuffs, which are embroidered
with cloud-patterns, and from the hats hang tasseled pendants. They are worn by all
holders of official rank, from the notables downwards. The common people merely
wear round their heads a piece of white muslin about six feet long. The wives of rich
or important people wind round their heads a piece of black or purple gauze some
six or seven feet long. This sometimes has flowers embroidered on it or woven
patterns. The hair is always worn hanging down. Some cover it in a bag of floss-silk
which may be either plain or coloured; others wear a bag of cloth or plain silk.
Those who cover their heads with cotton or silk look just like Buddhist nuns. It is the
women of the common people who do so. Their clothes are generally made of
cotton, sewn like a straining-bag, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, with
sleeves sewn on. This is called the under robe and is worn by men and women alike.

Their carriages, boats and agricultural implements are made very differently from
ours. Their vessels are usually of brass or copper; sometimes of porcelain. They have
a kind of porcelain that is very like our Ting [delicate] ware. For holding wire they
use only glass. Their weapons are made of steel. In their markets they use gold coins
without a hole in the middle. There are native written characters on both sides. The
people are often very tall and strong; so much so that they can carry the heaviest
load without a carrying-beam. If a woman marries and the husband becomes poor,
she may go to another husband. If he goes on a journey and does not come back for
three months, his wife is allowed to marry again. Oddly enough some of the women
have beards and moustaches. There are certain persons called dashman who
understand the writing of the country and are in charge of records and documents.
THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE MONGOLS
Conquering Northern China, 1211–1215

After this in the Year of the Sheep
Chingis Khan set out to fight the people of Cathy [Northern China].
First he took the city of Fuzhou
then marching through the Wild Fox Pass
he took Xuandefu.
From here he sent out an army under Jebe’s command
to take the fortress at the Zhuyongguan.
When Jebe arrived he saw the Zhuyongguan was well defended,
so he said:
“I’ll trick them and make them come out in the open.
I’ll pretend to retreat
and when they come out I’ll attack them.”
So Jebe retreated and the Cathayan army cried:
“Let’s go after them!”
They poured out of their fortifications
until the valleys and mountainsides were full of their soldiers.
Jebe retreated to Sondi-i-wu Ridge
and there he turned his army around to attack
as the enemy rushed towards him in waves.
The Cathayan army was beaten
and close behind Jebe’s forces
Chingis Khan commanding the great Middle Army attacked as well,
forcing the Cathayan army to retreat,

killing the finest and most courageous soldiers of Cathay,
the Jurchin and Kara Khitan fighters,
slaughtered them along the sides of Zhuyongguan
so that their bodies lay piled up like rotting trees.…
Recruiting Administrators, 1220s

Once he had conqured the Moslem people
Chigis Khan appointed agents to govern in each of their cities.
From the city of Gurganj came two Khawarezm [present-day Uzbekistan]
Moslems,

a father and son named Yalavech and Masgud,
who explained to Chingis Khan the customs and laws of these cities
and the customs by which they were governed.
Chingis Khan appointed the Khwarezm Masgud head of the agents
who governed the cities of the Turkestan:
Bukhara, Samarkand, Guranj, Khotan, Kashgar, Yarkand, and Kusen Tarim.
And his father Yalavech he made governor of the city of Zhongdu in Cathay.
Since among all the Moslems Yalavech and Masgud
were the most skilled at the customs and laws for governing cities,
he appointed them the governors of Cathay,
along with our own agents.…
RUSSIAN REACTIONS: THE NOVGOROD CHRONICLE
The Novgorod Chronicle is one of the most vital documents from postclassical
Russia—or what is more properly called Kievan Russia, the first development of a
Russian civilization centered in what is now western Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.
Maintained by Orthodox monks and reflecting their fervent religion, the Chronicle
detailed major events, without much interpretation save that inspired by religious
and local loyalties. Novgorod was a trading city of 250,000 people on the route
between Scandinavia and Byzantium. As Kievan Rus fell apart in the twelfth century,
Novgorod developed an increasingly independent regional government and army.
During the mid–thirteenth century (from 1240 to 1263) the city was ruled by Prince
Alexander Nevsky, who won important victories over Germans and Swedes but
submitted to Mongol—called Tartar in the Chronicle—tax gatherers in order to buy
his city’s independence. Alexander also visited Mongol leaders to negotiate for his
city. Mongol incursions occurred, but Novgorod remained the only Russian state to
escape full Mongol (Tartar) control. Only in the late fourteenth century did the city
begin to lose more of its independence, to the expanding Russian government now
based in Moscow.

A.D. 1224. The same year for our sins, unknown tribes came, whom no one exactly
knows, who they are, nor whence they came out, nor what their language is, nor of
what race they are, nor what their faith is; but they call them Tartars.… God alone
knows who they are and whence they came out. Very wise men know them exactly,
who understand books; but we do not know who they are, but have written of them
here for the sake of the memory of the Russian Princes and of the misfortune which
came to them from them. For we have heard that they have captured many
countries.…
A.D. 1238. And the accursed ones having come thence took Moscow, Pereyaslavl,
Yurev, Dmitrov, Volok, and Tver; there also they killed the son of [King] Yaroslav.
And thence the lawless ones came and invested [the city of] Torzhok on the festival
of the first Sunday in Lent. They fenced it all round with a fence as they had taken
other towns, and here the accursed ones fought with battering rams for two weeks.
And the people in the town were exhausted and from Novgorod there was no help
for them; but already every man began to be in perplexity and terror. And so the
pagans took the town, and slew all from the male sex even to the female, all the

priests and the monks, and all stripped and reviled gave up their souls to the Lord in
a bitter and a wretched death, on March 5, the day of the commemoration of the
holy Martyr Nikon, on Wednesday in Easter week. And there, too, were killed Ivanko
the Posadnik of Novi-torg, Yakin Vlunkovich, Gleb Borisovich and Mikhailo
Moiseivich. And the accursed godless ones then pushed on from Torzhok by the road
of Seregeri right up to Ignati’s cross, cutting down everybody like grass, to within
[50 miles] of Novgorod. God, however, and the great and sacred apostolic cathedral
Church of St. Sophia, and St. Kyuril, and the prayers of the holy and orthodox
archbishop, of the faithful Princess, and of the very reverend monks finally ended
the attack.…
The same winter the accursed raw-eating Tartars, Berkai and Kasachik, came with
their wives, and many others, and there was a great tumult in Novgorod, and they
did much evil in the provinces, taking contribution for the accursed Tartars. And the
accursed ones began to fear death; they said to [Prince] Alexander: “Give us guards,
lest they kill us.” And the Prince ordered… all the sons of the Boyars [nobles] to
protect them by night. The Tartars said: “Give us your numbers for tribute or we will
run away.” And the common people would not give their numbers for tribute but
said: “Let us die honourably for St. Sophia and for the angelic houses.” Then the
people were divided: who was good stood by St. Sophia and by the True Faith; and
they made opposition; the greater men bade the lesser be counted for tribute. And
the accursed ones wanted to escape, driven by the Holy Spirit, and they devised an
evil counsel how to strike at the town at the other side, and the others at this side by
the lake; and Christ’s power evidently forbade them, and they durst not. And
becoming frightened they began to crowd to one point to St. Sophia, saying: “Let us
lay our heads by St. Sophia.” And it was on the morrow, the Prince rode down …and
the accursed Tartars with him, and by the counsel of the evil they numbered
themselves for tribute; for the Boyars thought it would be easy for themselves, but
fall hard on the lesser men. And the accursed ones began to ride through the streets,
writing down the Christian houses; because for our sins God has brought wild beasts
out of the desert to eat the flesh of the strong, and to drink the blood of the Boyars.
And having numbered them for tribute and taken it, the accursed ones went away,
and Alexander followed them, having set his son Dmitri on the throne.
THE WEST AND THE MONGOLS: MARCO POLO
Marco Polo was one of the last, and certainly the most famous, Western travelers to
Mongol China. It is important to remember that a substantial series of travelers
visited in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and many of them wrote accounts.
Early emissaries, sent by the Pope, usually saw China and the Mongols in
disapproving religious terms, their censure heightened by fear of military prowess.
Later travelers, including Marco Polo, took a somewhat more accepting view, though
hints of the earlier approach remained. Increasingly, their reports contained
wondrous elements mixed with a fairly realistic, if awed, appraisal of China. Marco
Polo repeated a number of legends about fabulous wealth and mythical kings, along
with some solid data that increased European knowledge of Asia and of the benefits
of contact. Marco Polo (1254–1324) came from a Venetian merchant family; his
uncle and his father had gone to China in 1266. The family included Marco on a
later visit, and he apparently became a favorite of Kublai Khan, who made use of
him on business matters and in administering a city. Marco Polo returned to Italy
and was later imprisoned during a war with Genoa; it was here that he wrote his
account, which long served as the principal source of European information on

China. Recent historical scholarship has cast some doubt on his trip; he may not
have actually gone to China, but rather repeated his father’s and uncle’s account, as
well as available Persian guide books, while glorifying himself in the best Italian
Renaissance fashion. Nevertheless, his account reflected and promoted European
ideas about the Mongols and about China.

York: Doubleday, 1948), 134–35, 152–53, 178, 211, 216, 218, 221–22, 243–45.

In the middle of the hall, where the grand khan sits at table, there is a magnificent
piece of furniture, made in the form of a square coffer, each side of which is three
paces in length, exquisitely carved in figures of animals, and gilt. It is hollow within,
for the purpose of receiving a capacious vase, shaped like a jar, and of precious
materials, calculated to hold about a tun, and filled with wine. On each of its four
sides stands a smaller vessel, containing about a hogshead, one of which is filled
with mare’s milk, another with that of the camel, and so of the others, according to
the kinds of beverage in use. Within this buffet are also the cups or flagons
belonging to his majesty, for serving the liquors. Some of them are of beautiful gilt
plate. Their size is such that, when filled with wine or other liquor, the quantity
would be sufficient for eight or ten men. Before every two persons who have seats at
the tables, one of these flagons is placed, together with a kind of ladle, in the form
of a cup with a handle, also of plate; to be used not only for taking the wine out of
the flagon, but for lifting it to the head. This is observed as well with respect to the
women as the men. The quantity and richness of the plate belonging to his majesty
[are] quite incredible. Officers of rank are likewise appointed, whose duty it is to see
that all strangers who happen to arrive at the time of the festival, and are
unacquainted with the etiquette of the court, are suitably accommodated with
places; and these stewards are continually visiting every part of the hall, inquiring of
the guests if there is anything with which they are unprovided, or whether any of
them wish for wine, milk, meat, or other articles, in which case it is immediately
brought to them by the attendants.…
… From the city of Kanbalu there are many roads leading to the different
provinces, and upon each of these, that is to say, upon every great high road, at the
distance of twenty-five or thirty miles, accordingly as the towns happen to be
situated, there are stations, with houses of accommodation for travellers, called
yamb or post-houses. These are large and handsome buildings, having several wellfurnished apartments, hung with silk, and provided with everything suitable to
persons of rank. Even kings may be lodged at these stations in a becoming manner,
as every article required may be obtained from the towns and strong places in the
vicinity; and for some of them the court makes regular provision. At each station
four hundred good horses are kept in constant readiness, in order that all messengers
going and coming upon the business of the grand khan, and all ambassadors, may
have relays, and, leaving their jaded horses, be supplied with fresh ones. Even in
mountainous districts, remote from the great roads, where there are no villages, and
the towns are far distant from each other, his majesty has equally caused buildings
of the same kind to be erected, furnished with everything necessary, and provided
with the usual establishment of horses. He sends people to dwell upon the spot, in
order to cultivate the land, and attend to the service of the post; by which means
large villages are formed. In consequence of these regulations, ambassadors to the
court, and the royal messengers, go and return through every province and kingdom
of the empire with the greatest convenience and facility; in all of which the grand

khan exhibits a superiority over every other emperor, king, or human being. In his
dominions no fewer than two hundred thousand horses are thus employed in the
department of the post, and ten thousand buildings, with suitable furniture, are kept
up. It is indeed so wonderful a system, and so effective in its operation, as it is
scarcely possible to describe. If it be questioned how the population of the country
can supply sufficient numbers of these duties, and by what means they can be
victualled, we may answer, that all the idolaters [Chinese], and like-wise the
Saracens [Turks], keep six, eight, or ten women, according to their circumstances, by
whom they have a prodigious number of children; some of them as many as thirty
sons capable of following their fathers in arms; whereas with us a man has only one
wife, and even although she should prove barren, he is obliged to pass his life with
her, and is by that means deprived of the chance of raising a family. Hence it is that
our population is so much inferior to theirs.…
… [In Western China] these idolatrous people are treacherous and cruel, and
holding it no crime or turpitude to rob, are the greatest thieves in the world. They
subsist by the chase and by fowling, as well as upon the fruits of the earth.
Here are found the animals that produce the musk, and such is the quantity, that
the scent of it is diffused over the whole country. … In the rivers gold-dust is found
in very large quantities.…
Very different were [the habits] of Kublai-khan, emperor of the Tartars, whose
whole delight consisted in thoughts of a warlike nature, of the conquest of countries,
and of extending his renown.…
Of the province of Nan-ghin. Nan-ghin is the name of a large and distinguished
province of Manji, situated towards the west. The people are idolaters, use paper
money in currency, are subjects of the grand khan, and are largely engaged in
commerce. They have raw silk, and weave tissues of silver and gold in great
quantities, and of various patterns. The country produces abundance of corn [grain],
and is stored as well with domestic cattle as with beasts and birds that are the
objects of the chase, and plenty of tigers. It supplies the sovereign with an ample
revenue, and chiefly from the imposts levied upon the rich articles in which the
merchants trade.…
Sin-gui is a large and magnificent city, the circumference of which is twenty
miles. The inhabitants are idolaters, subjects of the grand khan, and use his paper
money. They have vast quantities of raw silk, and manufacture it, not only for their
own consumption, all of them being clothed in dresses of silk, but also for other
markets. There are amongst them some very rich merchants, and the number of
inhabitants is so great as to be a subject of astonishment. … They have amongst
them many physicians of eminent skill, who can ascertain the nature of the disorder,
and know how to apply the proper remedies. There are also persons distinguished as
professors of learning, or, as we should term them, philosophers, and others who
may be called magicians or enchanters. On the mountains near the city, rhubarb
grows in the highest perfection, and is from thence distributed throughout the
province. Ginger is likewise produced in large quantities, and is sold at so cheap a
rate, that forty pounds weight of the fresh root may be had for the value, in their
money, of a Venetian silver groat.…
Upon leaving the city of Kue-lin-fu, and travelling three days, during which you
are continually passing towns and castles, of which the inhabitants are idolaters,
have silk in abundance, and export it in considerable quantities, you reach the city
of Unguen. This place is remarkable for a great manufacture of sugar, which is sent

from thence to the city of Kanbalu for the supply of the court. Previously to its being
brought under the dominion of the grand khan, the natives were unacquainted with
the art of manufacturing sugar of a fine quality, and boiled it in such an imperfect
manner, that when left to cool it remained in the state of a dark-brown paste. But at
the time this city became subject to his majesty’s government, there happened to be
at the court some persons from Babylon who were skilled in the process, and who,
being sent thither, instructed the inhabitants in the mode of refining the sugar by
means of the ashes of certain woods.…
Travelling fifteen miles further in the same direction, you come to the city of Kangiu. … In this place is stationed a large army for the protection of the country, and
to be always in readiness to act, in the event of any city manifesting a disposition to
rebel. Through the midst of it passes a river, a mile in breadth, upon the banks of
which, on either side, are extensive and handsome buildings. In front of these, great
numbers of ships are seen lying, having merchandise on board, and especially sugar,
of which large quantities are manufactured here also. Many vessels arrive at this
port from India, freighted by merchants who bring with them rich assortments of
jewels and pearls, upon the sale of which they obtain a considerable profit. … The
ships coming from India ascend the river as high up as the city, which abounds with
every sort of provision, and has delightful gardens, producing exquisite fruits.…
… At the end of five days’ journey, you arrive at the noble and handsome city of
Zai-tun, which has a port on the sea-coast celebrated for the resort of shipping,
loaded with merchandise, that is afterwards distributed through every part of the
province of Manji. The quantity of pepper imported there is so considerable, that
what is carried to Alexandria, to supply the demand of the western parts of the
world, is trifling in comparison, perhaps not more than the hundredth part.

CHAPTER 14
AFRICA IN THE POSTCLASSICAL WORLD
Major developments took shape in sub-Saharan Africa during the postclassical
period. Large kingdoms formed in West Africa, including Ghana and then Mali, in
the region the Arabs called the Sudan. Trading cities developed along the east
African coast. Islam spread widely and had great influence, though the majority of
sub-Saharan Africans remained polytheists. In turn, Africa played a significant role
in the world trade of the period, and also developed centers of Islamic learning.
Sources for sub-Saharan Africa in the postclassical period are, however, somewhat
limited. The most important written documents come from travelers, mainly North
African Arabs but also, by the end of the period, a few Europeans. These accounts
have the advantage of an outsider perspective, but they also reflect the biases and
the pockets of ignorance foreign visitors often display. They reveal much about the
observers themselves, and their cultures of origin—and in the process they help
establish the context in which African trade and cultural connections developed.
The three documents in this chapter all deal with the southern Sahara and the
Sudanic region, though they focus on different specific places. Two emanate from
Islamic travelers, including the most tireless tourist of the postclassical era, Ibn
Battuta. One comes from a European merchant. All suggest significant
characteristics of this wide zone of Africa.
Questions
1. What common African features do the three documents describe, concerning
political, cultural, and economic activity?
2. What are the most important weaknesses of the traveler accounts, in terms of
distorting biases or apparent ignorance?
3. Which of the three accounts seems most reliable, and why?
4. Do the accounts suggest significant differences in the evaluation of Africa between
Muslim travelers on the one hand and the European Christian on the other? What
might explain major differences?
5. What kinds of interregional contacts did the Sudanic kingdoms maintain in the
postclassical period?
For Further Discussion
1. Do the accounts suggest potential differences between the African-Arab relations
and the African-European relations that would develop in the next world history
period?
2. How did the political institutions of sub-Saharan Africa compare with those of the
Middle East and Western Europe during the postclassical period?
ABD AL-AZIZ AL-BAKRI
Abd al-Aziz al-Bakri was a Muslim scholar in Spain in the eleventh century (he died
in 1084). He never traveled to Africa directly, but accumulated many other accounts
(most of which have since been lost) and also met many travelers and merchants
coming from the Sudan. He provides one of the most important sources available on

Africa in the period.

This is the independent kingdom of the Farwiyyun. Among the strange things found
there is a pool where water collects and in it a plant grows of which the roots are
the surest means of strengthening and aiding sexual powers. The king reserves this
for himself and does not allow anyone else to partake of it. He owns an enormous
number of women, and when he wants to make the round of them he warns them
one day before, takes the medicine, and then takes them all in turn and scarcely
flags. One of the neighboring Muslim kings gave him precious gifts, requesting some
of this plant in exchange. In return he gave presents of equal value and wrote a
letter saying: “Muslims may lawfully wed only a few women, and I fear that if I sent
you this medicine you would not be able to restrain yourself and you would commit
excesses which your religion makes unlawful. I am however, sending you an herb
which will enable an impotent man, if he eats it, to beget children.” In the country
of the Farwiyyun salt is exchanged for gold.
GHANA AND THE CUSTOMS OF ITS INHABITANTS

Ghana is a title given to their kings; the name of the region is Akwar, and their king
today, namely in the year 460/1067–8 is Tunka Manin. He ascended the throne in
455/1063. The name if his predecessor was Basi and he became their ruler at the age
of 85. He led a praiseworthy life on account of his love of justice and friendship for
the Muslims. At the end of his life he became blind, but he concealed this from his
subjects and pretended that he could see. When something was put before him he
said: “This is good” or “This is bad.” His ministers deceived the people by indicating
to the king in cryptic words what he should say, so that the commoners could not
understand. Basi was a maternal uncle of Tunka Manin. This is their custom and
their habit, that the kingship is inherited only by the son of the king’s sister. He has
no doubt that his successor is a son of his sister, while he is not certain that his son
is in fact his own, and he is not convinced of the genuineness of his relationship to
him. This Tunka Manin is powerful, rules an enormous kingdom, and possesses great
authority.

African History, trans. J. R. Hopkins (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981),

The city of Ghana consists of two towns situated on a plain. One of these towns,
which is inhabited by Muslims, is large and possesses twelve mosques, in one of
which they assemble for the Friday prayer. There are salaried imams and muezzins,
as well as jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from
which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. The king’s town is six miles
distant from this one and bears the name of Al-Ghaba. Between these two towns
there are continuous habitations. The houses of the inhabitants are of stone and
acacia (sunt) wood. The king has a palace and a number of domed dwellings all
surrounded with an enclosure like a city wall (sur). In the king’s town, and not far
from his court of justice, is a mosque where the Muslims who arrive at his court
(yafid ‘alayh) pray. Around the king’s town are domed buildings and groves and
thickets where the sorcerers of these people, men in charge of the religious cult, live.
In them too are their idols and the tombs of their kings. These woods are guarded
and none may enter them and know what is there. In them also are the king’s
prisons. If somebody is imprisoned there no news of him is ever heard. The king’s

interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers
are Muslims. Among the people who follow the king’s religion only he and his heir
apparent (who is the son of his sister) may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear
robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. All of them shave their
beards, and women shave their heads. The king adorns himself like a woman
[wearing necklaces] round his neck and [bracelets] on his forearms, and he puts on
a high cap (tartur) decorated with gold and wrapped in a turban of fine cotton. He
sits in audience or to hear grievances against officials (mazalim) in a domed
pavilion around which stand ten horses covered with gold-embroidered materials.
Behind the king stand ten pages holding shields and swords decorated with gold, and
on his right are the sons of the [vassal] kings of his country wearing splendid
garments and their hair plaited with gold. The governor of the city sits on the
ground before the king and around him are ministers seated likewise. At the door of
the pavilion are dogs of excellent pedigree who hardly ever leave the place where
the king is, guarding him. Round their necks they wear collars of gold and silver
studded with a number of balls of the same metals. The audience is announced by
the beating of a drum which they call duba, made from a long hollow log. When the
people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their
knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for
the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands.
Their religion is paganism and the worship of idols (dakakir). When their king
dies they construct over the place where his tomb will be an enormous dome of saj
wood. Then they bring him on a bed covered with a few carpets and cushions and
place him beside the dome. At this side they place his ornaments, his weapons, and
the vessels from which he used to eat and drink, filled with various kinds of food
and beverages. They place there too the men who used to serve his meals. They close
the door of the dome and cover it with mats and furnishings. Then the people
assemble, who heap earth upon it until it becomes like a big hillock and dig a ditch
around it until the mound can be reached at only one place.
They make sacrifices to their dead and make offerings of intoxicating drinks. On
every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one
gold dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king’s due
is five mithquals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. The best gold found
in his land comes from the town over a country inhabited by tribes of the Sudan
whose dwellings are continuous.
The nuggets (nadra) found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the
king, only this gold dust (al-tibr al-daqiq) being left for the people. But for this the
people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. The nuggets may weigh from an
ounce (uqiyya) to a pound (ratl). It is related that the king owns a nugget as large as
a big stone.…
The king of Ghana, when he calls up his army, can put 200,000 men into the field,
more than 40,000 of them archers. The horses in Ghana are very small. … the
inhabitants sow their crops twice yearly, the first time in the moist earth (thara)
during the season of the Nil flood, and later in the earth [that has preserved its
humidity].
West of Ghiyaru, on the Nil, is the town of Yarisna, inhabited by Muslims
surrounded by polytheists. In Yarisna is a species of small goat. When a goat gives
birth to a male it is slaughtered, only females being allowed to live. In this country
is a certain tree against which the goats rub themselves and become fecundated by

the wood without the medium of the male. This fact is well known to them; none of
them deny it and it has been related by many trustworthy Muslims. From Yarisna the
Sudan who speak an unintelligible language (a’jam pl. ‘ujm) called the Banu
Naghmarata, who are merchants, export gold to other countries.…
Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which is known as
almusulmani. He is thus called because his country became afflicted with drought
one year following another; the inhabitants prayed for rain, sacrificing cattle till
they had exterminated almost all of them, but the drought and the misery only
increased. The king had as his guest a Muslim who used to read the Koran and was
acquainted with the Sunna. To this man the king complained of the calamities that
assailed him and his people. The man said; “O King, if you believed in God (who is
exalted) and testified that He is One, and testified as to the prophetic mission of
Muhammad (God bless him and give him peace) and if you accepted all the religious
laws of Islam, I would pray for your deliverance from your plight and that God’s
mercy would envelop all the people of your country and that your enemies and
adversaries might envy you on that account.” Thus he continued to press the king
until the latter accepted Islam and became a sincere Muslim. The man made him
recite from the Koran some easy passages and taught him religious obligations and
practices which no one may be excused from knowing. Then the Muslim made him
wait till the eve of the following Friday, when he ordered him to purify himself by a
complete ablution, and clothed him in a cotton garment which he had. The two of
them came out towards a mound of earth, and there the Muslim stood praying while
the king, standing at his right side, imitated him. Thus they prayed for part of the
night, the Muslim reciting invocations and the king saying “Amen.” The dawn had
just started to break when God caused abundant rain to descend upon them. So the
king ordered the idols to be broken and expelled the sorcerers from his country. He
and his descendants after him as well as his nobles were sincerely attached to Islam,
while the common people of the kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their
rulers have been given the title of almusulmani.
Among the provinces (a’mal) of Ghana is a region called Sama, the inhabitants of
which are known as al-Bukm. From that region to Ghana is four days’ traveling. The
people there go naked; only the women cover their sexual parts with strips of leather
which they plait. They leave the hair on the pubis and only shave their heads. Abu
‘Abd Allah al-Makki related that he saw one of these women stop in front of an
Arab, who had a long beard, and say something that he could not understand. He
asked the interpreter about the meaning of her words. He replied that she wished
that she had hair like that of his beard on her pubis. The Arab, filled with anger,
called down curses upon her.…
From Bughrat you go to Tiraqqa and from there across the desert plain to
Tadmakka, which of all the towns of the world is the one that resembles Mecca the
most. Its name means “the Mecca-like.” It is a large town amidst mountains and
ravines and is better built than Ghana or Kawkaw. The inhabitants of Tadmakka are
Muslim Berbers who veil themselves as the Berbers of the desert do. They live on
meat and milk as well as on grain which the earth produces without being tilled.
Sorghum and other grains are imported for them from the land of the Sudan. They
wear clothes of cotton, nuli, and other robes dyed red. Their kings wears a red
turban, yellow shirt, and blue trousers. Their dinars are called “bald” because they
are of pure gold without any stamp. Their women are of perfect beauty, unequalled
among people of any other country, but adultery is allowed among them. They fall
upon any merchant [disputing as to] which of them shall take him to her house.…

When a traveler goes from the country of Kawkaw along the bank of the river in a
westerly direction he reached the kingdom called Damdam, the people of which eat
anyone who falls into their hands. They have a great king to whom minor rulers are
subject. In their country there is a huge fortress surmounted by an idol (sanam) in
the form of a woman which they worship as their God and to which they go on
pilgrimage.
Between Tadamakka and the town of Kawkaw is a distance of nine stages. The
Arabs call the inhabitants of the latter the BZRKANYYN. This town consists of two
towns, one being the residence of the king and the other inhabited by the Muslims.
The king is called Qanda. The clothes of the people there are like those of the other
Sudan, consisting of a robe (milhafa) and a garment of skins or some other material,
according to each man’s individual means. They worship idols (dakakir) as do the
other Sudan. When their king sits down [to partake of a meal] a drum is beaten, the
Sudanese women dance with their thick hair flowing, and nobody in the town goes
about his business until he has finished his repast, the remnants of which are thrown
into the Nile. At this [the couriers] shout out boisterously so that the people know
that the king has finished his meal. When the king ascends the throne he is handed a
signet ring, a sword, and a copy of the Koran which, as they assert, were sent to
them by the Commander of the Faithful. Their king is a Muslim, for they entrust the
kingship only to Muslims.…
IBN BATTUTA
Ibn Battuta (1304–1369) was a North African Arab who visited many African
kingdoms during the fourteenth century. An indefatigable traveler, over a thirty-year
span he also visited many parts of Asia and islands in the Indian Ocean and proudly
wrote about his observations. His account obviously warrants comparison with that
of al-Bakri, being a traveler’s vs. a scholar’s account but also a fourteenth- vs. an
eleventh-century account.

ANECDOTE CONCERNING THE MASSUFA WHO INHABIT IWALATAN

The conditions of these people is strange and their manners outlandish. As for their
men, there is no sexual jealous in them. And none of them derives his genealogy
from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass
on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. Now
that is a thing I never saw in any part of the world except in the country of the
unbelievers of the land of Mulaibar [Malabar] among the Indians. As to the former
[the Mass-ufa], they are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh [Islamic
jurisprudence], and learning the Koran by heart. With regard to their women, they
are not modest in the presence of men, they do not veil themselves in spite of their
perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but
the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that,
she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and
companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [other than
brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst
women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find
his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.…

The sultan [emperor of Mali] has a raised cupola which is entered from inside his
house. He sits in it a great part of the time. It has on the audience side a chamber
with three wooden arches, the woodwork is covered with sheets of beaten silver and
beneath these, three more covered with beaten gold, or, rather, it is silver covered
with gilt. The windows have woolen curtains which are raised on a day when the
sultan will be in session in his cupola: thus it is known that he is holding a session.
When he sits, a silken cord is put out from the grill of one of the arches with a scarf
of Egyptian embroidery tied to it. When the people see the scarf, drums are beaten
and bugles sounded. Then from the door of the palace come out about three
hundred slaves. Some have bows in their hands and some small spears and shields.
Some of the spearmen stand on the right and some on the left, the two bowmen sit
likewise. Then they bring two mares saddled and bridled, and with the two rams.
They say that these are effective against the evil eye. When the sultan has sat down
three of his slaves go out quickly to call his deputy, Qanja Musa. The farariyya
[commanders] arrive, and they are the amirs [officers], and among them are the
preacher and the men of fiqh, who sit in front of the armed men on the right and
left of the place of audience. The interpreter Dugha stands at the door of the
audience chamber wearing splendid robes of zardkhuana [official] and others. On
his head is a turban which has fringes, they have a superb way of tying a turban. He
is girt with a sword whose sheath is of gold, on his feet are light boots and spurs.
And nobody wears boots that day except he. In his hands there are two small spears,
one of gold and one of silver with points of iron. The soldiers, the district governors,
the pages and the Massufa and others are seated outside the place of audience in a
broad street which has trees in it. Each farari [commander] has his followers before
him with their spears, bows, drums and bugles made of elephant tusks. Their
instruments of music are made of reeds and calabashes, and they beat them with
sticks and produce a wonderful sound. Each farari has a quiver which is placed
between his shoulders. He holds his bow in his hand and is mounted on a mare.
Some of his men are on foot and some on mounts.
Inside the audience chamber under the arches a man is standing; he who wants to
spead to the sultan speaks to Dugha, Dugha speaks to the man who is standing, and
he speaks to the sultan.
An Account of the Session in the Place of Audience

The sultan sits on certain days in the palace yard to give audience. There is a
platform under a tree steps which they call banbi. It is covered with silk and has
pillows placed on it. The shatr [umbrella] is raised, this is a shelter made of silk with
a golden bird like a sparrowhawk above it. The sultan comes out from a gate in the
corner of the palace, bow in hand, his quiver between his shoulders, and on his head
a cap of gold tied with a golden band which has fringes like thin-bladed knives more
than a span long. He often wears a robe which is soft and red, made from Roman
cloth … mutanfas. The singers go out before him carrying gold and silver qanabir
[guitars] and behind him come three hundred armed armed slaves. The sultan walks
slowly and pauses often and sometimes he stops completely. When he comes to the
banbi he stops and looks at the people. Then he mounts the steps with dignity in the
manner of a preacher getting into the pulpit. When he sits down they beat the
drums, blow the bugles and the horns, and three of the slaves go out in haste and
call the deputy and the farariyya [commanders]. They enter and sit down. The two
mares are brought in with the two rams. Damugha stands at the door while the rest
of the people are in the street under the tree. The blacks are the most humble of men

before their king and the most extreme in their self-abasement before him. They
swear by his name, saying ‘Mansa Sulaimanki’ [the law of Mansa Sulaimanki]. When
he calls one of them while he is in session in his cupola which we described above,
the man invited takes off his clothes and wears patched clothes, takes off his turban,
puts on a dirty cap, and goes in raising his clothes and trousers up his legs half-way
to his knees. He advances with humility looking like a beggar. He hits the ground
with his elbows, he hits it hard. He stands bowed, like one in the ruku’ position in
prayer, listening to what the king says. When one of them speaks to the sultan and
gives him an answer, he removed his clothes from his back and throw dust on his
head and back, as a person does when bathing with water. I used to wonder how
they do not blind their eyes. When the sultan speaks in his council, at his word those
present take their turbans off their heads and listen to the speech.…
Amongst their good qualities is the small amount of injustice amongst them, for
of all people they are the furthest from it. Their sultan does not forgive anyone in
any matter to do with justice. Among these qualities there is also the prevalence of
peace in their country, the traveler is not afraid in it nor is he who lives there in fear
of the thief or of the robber by violence. They do not interfere with the property of
the white man who dies in their country even though it may consist of great wealth,
but rather they entrust it to the hand of someone dependable among the white men
until it is taken by the rightful claimant.
Another of the good habits amongst them is the way they meticulously observe
the times of the prayers and attendance at them, so also it is with regard to their
congregational services and their beating of their children to instill these things in
them.
When it is Friday, if a man does not come early to the mosque he will not find a
place to pray because of the numbers of the crowd. It is their custom for every man
to send his boy with his prayer mat. He spreads it for him in a place commensurate
with his position and keeps the place until he comes to the mosque. Their prayer
mats are made of the leaves of a tree like a date palm but it bears no fruit.
Among their good qualities is their putting on of good white clothes on Friday. If
a man among them has nothing except a tattered shirt, he washes and cleans it and
attends the Friday prayer in it. Another of their good qualities is their concern for
learning the sublime Koran by heart. They make fetters for their children when they
appear on their part to be falling short in their learning of it by heart, and they are
not taken off from them until they do learn by heart. I went in to visit the qadi on
an ‘Id day and his children were tied up. I said to him ‘Why do you not release
them?’ He said, ‘I shall not do so until they learn the Koran by heart.’ One day I
passed by a handsome youth from them dressed in fine clothes and on his feet was a
heavy chain. I said to the man who was with me, ‘What has this youth done—has he
killed someone?’ The youth heard my remark and laughed. It was told me, ‘He has
been chained so that he will learn the Koran by heart.’
Among the bad things which they do—their serving women, slave women and
little daughters appear before people naked, exposing their private parts. I used to
see many of them in this state in Ramadan, for it was the custom of the farariyya
[commanders] to break the fast in the sultan’s house. Everyone of them has his food
carried into him by twenty or more of his slave girls and they are naked, every one.
Also among their bad customs is the way women will go into the presence of the
sultan naked, with out any covering; and the nakedness of the sultan’s daughters—
on the night of the twenty-seventh of Ramadan, I saw about a hundred slave girls

coming out of his palace with food, with them were two of his daughters, they had
full breasts and no clothes on. Another of their bad customs is their putting of dust
and ashes on their heads as assign of respect. And another is the laughing matter I
mentioned of their poetic recitals. And another is that many of them eat animals not
ritually slaughtered, and dogs and donkeys.
AFRICA THROUGH THE EYES OF A EUROPEAN MERCHANT
ANTONIUS MALFANTE

Antonius Malfante wrote from Tuat (Tawat) in the central Sahara in 1447, to a
colleague in Genoa. His travels suggest growing European outreach, for contact with
Africa below the Sahara had been limited since the fall of the Roman Empire. Genoa
was increasingly active in Mediterranean trade, and presumably Malfante’s venture
was part of this activity, as his account itself implies. He seems to have traveled
fairly widely in the region and was also eager to report what he thought he learned
about places he did not visit directly.

•••
After we had come from the sea, we journeyed on horseback, always southwards, for
about twelve days. For seven days we encountered no dwelling—nothing but sandy
plains; we proceeded as though at sea, guided by the sun during the day, at night by
the stars. At the end of the seventh day, we arrived at an oasis, where dwelt very
poor people who supported themselves on water and a little sandy ground. They sow
little, living upon the numerous date palms. At this [oasis] we had come into Tueto
[Tawat, a group of oases]. In this place there are eighteen quarters, enclosed within
one wall, and ruled by an oligarchy. Each ruler of a quarter protects his followers,
whether they be in the right or no. The quarters closely adjoin each other and are
jealous of their privileges. Everyone arriving here places himself under the
protection of one of these rulers, who will protect him to the death: thus merchants
enjoy very great security, much greater, in my opinion, than in other North African
kingdoms such as Tunis.
Though I am a Christian, no one ever addressed an insulting word to me. They
said they had never seen a Christian before. It is true that on my first arrival they
were scornful of me, because they all wished to see me, saying with wonder “This
Christian has a countenance like ours”—for they believed that Christians had
disguised faces. Their curiosity was soon satisfied, and now I can go alone anywhere,
with no one to say an evil word to me.
There are many Jews, who lead a good life here, for they are under the protection
of the several rulers, each of whom defends his own clients. Thus they enjoy very
secure social standing. Trade is in their hands, and many of them are to be trusted
with the greatest confidence.
This locality is a mart of the country of the African Muslims, to which merchants
come to sell their goods: gold is carried hither, and bought by those who come up
from the coast. There are many rich men here. The generality, however, are very

poor, for they do not sow, nor do they harvest anything, save the dates upon which
they subsist. They eat no meat but that of castrated camels, which are scarce and
very dear.
It is true that the Arabs with whom I came from the coast brought with them
corn and barley which they sell throughout the year.
It never rains here: if it did, the houses, being built of salt in the place of reeds,
would be destroyed. It is scarcely ever cold here: in summer the heat is extreme,
wherefore they are almost all blacks. The children of both sexes go naked up to the
age of fifteen. These people observe the religion and law of Muhammad. In the
vicinity there are 150 to 200 oases.
In the lands of the Blacks, as well as here, dwell the Tuareg, who live, like the
Arabs, in tents. They are without number, and hold sway over the land from the
borders of Egypt to the shores of the Ocean [present-day Liberia], and over all the
neighboring towns of the blacks. They are fair, strong in body and very handsome in
appearance. They ride without stirrups, with simple spurs. They are governed by
kings, whose heirs are the sons of their sisters—for such is their law. They keep their
mouths and noses covered. I have seen many of them here, and have asked them
through an interpreter why they cover their mouths and noses thus. They replied:
“We have inherited this custom from our ancestors.” Their faith is that of the Blacks.
Their sustenance is milk and flesh, no corn or barley, but much rice. Their sheep,
cattle, and camels are without number. One breed of camel, white as snow, can
cover in one day a distance which would take a horseman four days to travel. Great
warriors, these people are continually at war amongst themselves.
The states which are under their rule border upon the land of the Blacks. I shall
speak of those known to men here, and which have inhabitants of the faith of
Muhammad. In all, the great majority are Blacks, but there are a small number of
white [i.e. tawny Moors].…
These adhere to the law of Muhammad.
To the south of these are innumerable great cities and territories, the inhabitants
of which are all blacks and idolaters, continually at war with each other in defense
of their law and faith of their idols. Some worship the sun, others the moon, the
seven planets, fire, or water; others a mirror which reflects their faces, which they
take to be the images of gods; others groves of trees, the seats of a spirit to whom
they make sacrifice; others again, statues of wood and stone, with which, they say,
they commune by incantations. They relate here extraordinary things of this people.
The lord in whose protection I am, here, who is the greatest in this land, having a
fortune of more than 100,000 doubles [a coin], a man worthy of credence, relates
that he lived for thirty years in that town, and, as he says, for fourteen years in the
land of the Blacks. Every day he tells me wonderful things of these peoples. He says
that these lands and peoples extend endlessly to the south: they all go naked, save
for a small loincloth to cover their privates. They have an abundance of flesh, milk,
and rice, but no corn or barley.
The slaves which the blacks take in their internecine wars are sold at a very low
price. These peoples, who cover the land in multitudes, are in carnal acts like the
beasts. They breed greatly, for a woman bears up to five at a birth. Nor can it be
doubted that they are eaters of human flesh, for many people have gone hence into
their country. Neither are there ever epidemics.
When the blacks catch sight of a white man from a distance, they take to flight as

though from a monster, believing him to be a phantom. They are unlettered, and
without books. They are great magicians, evoking by incense diabolical spirits, with
whom, they say, they perform marvels.
The wares for which there is demand here are many: but the principal articles are
copper, and salt in slabs, bars and cakes. The copper of Romania [the Byzantine
Empire], which is obtained through Alexandria, is always in great demand
throughout the land of the Blacks. I frequently enquired what they did with it, but
no one could give me a definite answer. I believe it is that there are so many peoples
that there is almost nothing but is of use to them.
The Egyptian merchants come to trade in the land of the Black with half a million
head of cattle and camels—a figure which is not fantastic in this region.
The place where I am is good for trade, as the Egyptians and other merchants
come hither form the land of the Blacks bringing gold, which they exchange for
copper and other goods. Thus everything sells well; until there is nothing left for
sale. The people here will neither sell nor buy unless at a profit of one hundred per
cent. For this reason, I have lost on the goods I brought here, two thousand doubles.
From what I can understand, these people neighbor on India. Indian merchants
come hither, and converse through interpreters. These Indians are Christians, adorers
of the cross. It is said that in the land of the Blacks there are forty dialects, so that
they are unable to understand each other.
I often enquired where the gold was found and collected; my patron always
replied “I was fourteen years in the land of the Blacks, and I have never heard nor
seen anyone who could reply from definite knowledge. That is my experience, as to
how it is found and collected. What appears plain is that it comes from a distant
land, and, as I believe, from a definite zone.” He also said that he had been in places
where silver was as valuable as gold.

CHAPTER 15
CHINESE AND PORTUGUESE VOYAGES IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
One of the last great sets of events of the postclassical period involved the several
Chinese voyages through the Indian ocean between 1405 and 1433, under the new
Ming dynasty. One of the first great events of the next, early modern period was the
voyage of the Portuguese Vasco da Gama around Africa to India. Documents in this
chapter compare two Chinese trips, the last one launched in 1430, and da Gama’s
historic venture.
These were very different expeditions, from very different countries. Accounts of
the two voyages clearly allow comparisons of the scopes and some of the
motivations involved. Historians continue to debate exactly what the Chinese
expeditions were all about—like the Portuguese, they were directly authorized by
the ruler—but the sources suggest several of the factors involved. At the same time it
is valid to look for similarities as well: after all, these were major expeditions, and it
is important to ask why they occurred so close together in time, reaching some of
the same places (notably East Africa, the port of Hormuz in the Middle East, and the
southwest Indian port of Calicut).
The sources merit assessment as well in terms of possible bias. There is little
documentation about the Chinese trips, which were ended in 1433 amid court
disfavor, but the artisan who wrote the documents included here surely wanted
some credit, if not for himself at least for the expedition as a whole. Vasco da
Gama’s account was intended for his royal sponsors and other possible supporters
back home.
The two series had very different outcomes. China’s venture was exceptionally
ambitious and in many ways successful, but the fact that it was not continued, as
China found other ways to profit from interregional trade, limits its ongoing
significance in world history. Historians often, in fact, spend more time discussing
why the trips stopped than they do discussing the voyages themselves. Da Gama’s
venture, later repeated with more firepower, launched a major Portuguese
commitment to oceanic trade and colonization in the Indian Ocean and elsewhere,
which in turn was part of Western Europe’s commercial surge in the early modern
centuries.
Questions
1. What were the main motives of the two expeditions? How do they compare?
2. What do the accounts suggest about the nature of the expeditions—their scope
and power? What kinds of receptions did the expeditions receive (at least,
according to the authors) and how do these compare?
3. What kinds of attitudes toward foreigners did the Chinese and the Portuguese
display?
4. Why was there such great interest in the Indian Ocean?
5. What were the motives of people who wrote expedition accounts at this point in
history? What kinds of distortions might result?
6. What do the documents suggest about the significance of the two expeditions?
For Further Discussion

1. Why was there new interest in ocean-based commerce in the fifteenth century?
What kinds of technologies were involved?
2. Why did China judge that it was sensible to stop its expeditions, whereas Portugal
pressed ahead as long as possible?
3. Why were foreign expeditions often well received?
4. How do these expeditions compare with earlier patterns of interregional trade in
Africa-Asia-Europe?
MA HUAN
Ma Huan was a woodcutter who probably went on several trips with the great
admiral Cheng Ho. The first selection is a poem that he may have written. It
appeared in a novel by Lo Mou-teng, written in 1597, which was a very fanciful
account; but some historians believe it was actually written in 1416, about an
expedition that took place 1413–1415. The second selection refers to the 1430 trip,
in an account called The Overall Survey of the Ocean’s Shores, which Ma Huan
wrote in 1433.
•••
The Poem
The Emporer’s glorious envoy [Cheng Ho] received the divine commands,
‘proclaim abroad the silken sounds, and go to the barbarous lands.’
His giant ship on the roaring waves of the boundless ocean rode;
afar, o’er the rolling billows vast and limitless, it strode.
The vast sea’s rolling billows in lovely breakers sweep; … Java [Indonesia] he
quickly makes.
From the Central Glorious Country Java is distant far,
a noisome steam is heaven’s breath, and strange the people are.
With unkempt heads and naked feet, a barbarous tongue they speak;
dresses and hats they use not, nor manners nor virtue seek.
Here when the heavenly writing [the emperor’s commands] came, a happy
clamour meeting,
Chieftains and heads of the barbarous tribes all vied to give it greeting.
Tribute of southern gold, rare gems, from distant parts appear;
The shipmen lifted up their heads; the west with the east they mixed;
only pointing to the [Polaris] star whereby north and south were fixed.
Mountains high and mighty waves I ere then saw but few;
Unwonted gems and jewels rare I now began to view.
Above to heaven and down to earth I looked—no boundary ran;
To heaven’s ends and earth’s extremes each one is the sovereign’s man.
Union under imperial Ming our grand and great land shares;
from time forgotten until now no [other land] compares.
The Emperor’s envoy, dutiful, fears to tarry and delay;

just then he meets the south wind, which points to his homeward way.
O’er waves like swimming dragons huge [the envoy’s] vessel rides;
he turns his head back, mist and fog the distant desert hides.
To capital returned, the Palace levee he attended;
in Dragon Court his tribute, every precious thing extended.
One glance of the all-wise eyes [the court advisors], and joy filled Heaven’s face
[the emperor],
all dignities, gifts, were bestowed, new pledges of Heaven’s grace.
Ma Huan, the mountain-woodcutter of Kuei chi.

The Overall Survey of the Ocean’s Shores
This country of Mecca setting sail from the country of Calicut, you proceed towards
the south-west—the point shen on the compass; the ship travels for three moons, and
then reaches the jetty of this country. They profess the Muslim religion. A holy man
first expounded and spread this forth.…

trans. J. V. G. Mills (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970), 73–75.
Reprinted with the permission of Cambridge University Press.
Inside the wall [of the mosque], at the four corners, are built four towers; at every
service of worship they ascend these towers, call to the company, and chant the
ceremonial. On both sides, left and right, are the halls where all the patriarchs have
preached the doctrine; these, too, are built with layers of stone, and are decorated
most beautifully.…
[1430] An order was respectfully received from our imperial court that the
principle envoy the grand eunuch Chen Ho and others should go to all the foreign
countries to read out the imperial commands and to bestow rewards.
When a division of the fleet reached the country of Calicut, [the chief officer]
selected an interpreter and others, seven men in all, and sent them with a load of
musk, porcelain articles, and other such things; [and] they joined a ship of this
country [Calicut] and went there. It took them one year to return to China.
They bought all kinds of unusual commodities, and rare valuables, lions, ‘camelfowls,’ and other such things; in addition they painted an accurate representation of
the ‘Heavenly Hall,’ [and] they returned to the Chinese capital.
The king of the country of Mecca also sent envoys who brought some local
articles, accompanied the seven men—the interpreter [and others]—who had
originally gone there, and presented the articles to the court.
VASCO DA GAMA
Vasco da Gama was the first European to round Africa and reach India, after many
earlier fifteenth-century trips had crawled ever further down the west African coast.
He reached present-day South Africa in 1497, India a year later. He was able to
profit sufficiently from this first trip to interest Portugal in further efforts; a later,
second trip involved more abundant military preparation and use of cannon to
intimidate Indian rulers and merchants.

•••
VASCO DA GAMA: ROUND AFRICA TO INDIA, 1497–1498 C.E.

The inhabitants of this country are tawny-colored. Their food is confined to the flesh
of seals, whales and gazelles, and the roots of herbs. They are dressed in skins, and
wear sheaths over their virile members. They are armed with poles of olive wood to
which a horn, browned in the fire, is attached. Their numerous dogs resemble those
of Portugal, and bark like them. The birds of the country likewise, are the same as in
Portugal, and include cormorants, gulls, turtle doves, crested larks, and many others.
The climate is healthy and temperate, and produces good herbage. On the day after
we had cast anchor, that is to say on Thursday (November 9) we landed with the
captain-major [da Gama referred to himself in the third person], and made captive
one of the natives, who was small of stature. This man had been gathering honey in
the sandy waste, for in this country the bees deposit their honey at the foot of the
mounds around the bushes. He was taken on board the captain-major’s ship, and
being placed at table he ate of all we ate. On the following day the captain-major
had him well dressed and sent ashore.
From Oliver Thatcher, ed., The Library of Original Sources, vol. 1 (Milwaukee, Wis.:
University Research Extension Co.l, 1907), 26–40, scanned by J. S. Arkenberg of
California State University Fullerton, who modernized the text.
On the following day (November 10) fourteen or fifteen natives came to where our
ship lay. The captain-major landed and showed them a variety of merchandise, with
the view of finding out whether such things were to be found in their country. This
merchandise included cinnamon, cloves, seed-pearls, gold, and many other things,
but it was evident that they had no knowledge whatsoever of such articles, and they
were consequently given round bells and tin rings.
On that day Fernaro Velloso, who was with the captain-major, expressed a great
desire to be permitted to accompany the natives to their houses, so that he might
find out how they lived and what they ate. After a meal they expressed a desire that
he should not accompany them any further, but return to the vessels. When Fernao
Velloso came abreast of the vessels he began to shout, the negroes keeping in the
bush.
We were still at supper; but when his shouts were heard the captain-major rose at
once, and so did we others, and we entered a sailing boat. The negroes then began
running along the beach, and they came as quickly up with Fernao Velloso as we
did, and when we endeavored to get him into the boat they threw their assegais, and
wounded the captain-major and three or four others. All this happened because we
looked upon these people as men of little spirit, quite incapable of violence, and had
therefore landed without first arming ourselves. We then returned to the ships.
1498. Calicut [Arrival.] That night (May 20) we anchored two leagues from the city
of Calicut, and we did so because our pilot mistook Capna, a town at that place, for
Calicut. Still further there is another town called Pandarani. We anchored about a
league and a half from the shore. After we were at anchor, four boats (almadias)
approached us from the land, who asked of what nation we were. We told them, and
they then pointed out Calicut to us.
The city of Calicut is inhabited by Christians. [The first voyagers to Indian mistook
the Hindus for Christians.] They are of tawny complexion. Some of them have big
beards and long hair, whilst others clip their hair short or shave the head, merely
allowing a tuft to remain on the crown as a sign that they are Christians. They also

wear moustaches. They pierce the ears and wear much gold in them. They go naked
down to the waist, covering their lower extremities with very fine cotton stuffs. But
it is only the most respectable who do this, for the others manage as best they are
able. The women of this country, as a rule, are ugly and of small stature. They wear
many jewels of gold round the neck, numerous bracelets on their arms, and rings set
with precious stones on their toes. All these people are well-disposed and apparently
of mild temper. At first sight they seem covetous and ignorant.
When we arrived at Calicut the king was fifteen leagues away. The captain-major
sent two men to him with a message, informing him that an ambassador had arrived
from the King of Portugal with letters, and that if he desired it he would take them
to where the king then was. The king presented the bearers of this message with
much fine cloth. He sent word to the captain-major bidding him welcome, saying
that he was about to proceed to Calicut. As a matter of fact, he started at once with
a large retinue. At this time we were actually in front of the city of Calicut. We were
told that the anchorage at the place to which we were to go was good, whilst at the
place we were then it was bad, with a stony bottom, which was quite true; and,
moreover, that it was customary for the ships which came to this country to anchor
there for the sake of safety. We ourselves did not feel comfortable, and the captainmajor had no sooner received this royal message than he ordered the sails to be set,
and we departed. We did not, however, anchor as near the shore as the king’s pilot
desired.

PART III

The Early Modern Period, 1450–1750
BEGINNING IN THE MID–FIFTEENTH CENTURY, several new themes began to shape the larger

patterns of world history, compelling all major civilizations to come to terms with
some unexpected forces. The world did not become more homogeneous as a result,
because different regions reacted quite differently to the common themes. But every
society was altered in the process. New technologies, particularly guns and improved
navigational devices, changed world politics and trade. Western Europe expanded its
commercial role and created new empires. The Europeans eagerly sought new
prospects, and internal rivalries pushed individual states to seek colonies.
The rise of Western power soon brought Europe into contact with the Americas.
Exploitation of American resources and the establishment of colonies propelled the
Americas into international contacts for the first time since the arrival of people
from Asia many millennia before. European control and also European diseases and
animals now came to the Americas; and American crops such as corn and potatoes
were taken to many other parts of the world, encouraging rapid population growth
from China to Europe itself. American trade stimulated world commerce. Europe,
particularly, began to increase its manufacturing sector, while relying on fairly
traditional technologies and home-and shop-based production. It traded these
finished goods for raw materials, precious metals, and spices from other parts of the
world. Europe also managed to dominate most ocean-going trade, setting up huge
commercial companies that provided another source of profits. Asian producers also
benefited; China gained much of the American silver, which the Europeans used to
pay for silks and porcelain.
The intensifying commercial contacts around the world created a new set of
international inequalities. Some areas, such as Latin America, produced cheap
materials for export, depending on forced labor and lacking a large merchant class.
They became heavily dependent on European trade initiatives. Africa, though not
colonized like Latin America, was brought into this system through the slave trade;
millions of Africans were conscripted by African merchants and government agents
and sold to Europeans for transport to the Americas. Indonesia was drawn in,
through trade for spices and then because of Dutch-run colonies and estate
agriculture. India became open to growing European penetration by the eighteenth
century.
European gains, the inclusion of the Americas, and the formation of a more
intensive international economy were not the only themes of the period. A new set
of land-based empires formed, aided by the use of gunpowder and cannons. In the
most dramatic change, the Turkish-led Ottoman Empire covered a large part of the
Middle East, Egypt, and southeastern Europe; it replaced the loosening Arab political
control and pushed back Christianity in the northern part of the region. The fall of
Constantinople in 1453 essentially completed the conquest of the Christian
Byzantine Empire. India experienced a new, Muslim-led Mughal Empire that
dominated the Hindu majority during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The
Russian Empire began its expansion into central and eastern Asia and further into
Eastern Europe. Some of these empires, along with the more traditional Chinese
Empire, began to weaken somewhat toward the end of the early modern period, but
their power, political hold, and internal cultural impact shaped the regions involved
for several centuries. This was also a period of dramatic innovation in Japan, under

the Tokugawa shogunate, a kind of feudal monarchy.
The early modern period saw no sweeping cultural changes of international scope.
Islamic gains continued in parts of Asia. Christianity advanced particularly in the
Americas, on the heels of European conquest. Confucianism gained ground in Japan,
along with an extensive educational system. In Western Europe, a more scientific
outlook accompanied massive discoveries in physics and biology; only in the
eighteenth century, however, was this new intellectual framework exported,
haltingly, to places like Russia and the British colonies of North America.
Comparative analysis unquestionably helps focus key issues in understanding
world history in the early modern period. Comparisons in this chapter focus on four
basic developments in the early modern period; first, contacts among peoples that
had known each other little if at all previously, as global relationships were shaken
up particularly by the new European sea power; second, the installation of new or
vastly intensified labor systems to deal with problems of controlling workers and
producing goods often central to the growing world trade; third, the expansion of
land empires (which involved much continuity in China but important new
developments in the Ottoman Empire and Russia); and finally, outright interaction
with Western Europe, both by peoples now part of European colonies and by
societies independent but exposed to new or potential influences.

CHAPTER 16
EUROPEANS AND AMERICAN INDIANS
Explorers, Conquerors, and Aztec Reactions
The encounter between European explorers and settlers and Native Americans was
one of the most fascinating and, from the Indian standpoint, tragic, in world history.
Europeans came with technologies, animals, diseases, and religious views for which
the Indians had no prior preparation. Some Indians proved quite adaptable to the
context that European arrival established, gaining skill with horses, learning new
political forms, and so on. Overall, however, Europeans brought greater force,
devastating diseases, and an attitude of superiority that would combine to severely
restrict Indian life.
Comparisons in this chapter involve an unusual, highly significant case of
encounter, but also the interactions that developed key features of the Columbian
exchange. Early European arrivals, such as Columbus himself, often focused on the
naïveté and timidity of the Indians they encountered, wondering at their nakedness
and lack of metals and weapons but confident that they could proceed in friendship.
Columbus’s report on the 1492 voyage to the Caribbean islands shows this early
openness, but also the menace that underlay it: “I have also established the greatest
friendship with the king of that country, so much so that he took pride in calling me
his brother, and treating me as such. Even should these people change their
intentions towards us and become hostile, they do not know what arms are, but, as I
have said, go naked, and are the most timid people in the world; so that the men I
have left could, alone, destroy the whole country.”
Later accounts changed, and terms like deceitful and lazy, as well as pagan, began
to be applied to Indians. The following European accounts come from Diego Alvarez
Chanca, a surgeon on Columbus’s 1493 return to the Caribbean, who later published
a somewhat “ethnographic,” if hostile, account in his hometown of Seville, Spain;
from Hernando Cortés, in letters to the Spanish government as he began the
conquest of Mexico in 1519; and from the French explorer Champlain, in a diary
kept as he traveled the coasts of Maine and Cape Code in the early seventeenth
century.
The nature of the sources varies. Champlain and Chanca wrote accounts for
general interest; Cortés was reporting to the Spanish royalty. Which kind of account
is more accurate, less likely to exaggerate?
What of the Indian views implied in the European accounts? Why does their
outlook toward different Europeans vary—-or does it? Why did Europeans pick up
different signals about Indian reactions to the first presentations of Christianity?
There are few direct accounts of initial Indian responses, so it is important to
speculate on the basis of European descriptions of varying behaviors. Also, is there
any sign of a distinction, in dealing with Europeans, between the Indians of New
England or the Caribbean islands, who combined agriculture and hunting, and the
Indians in that part of Mexico long embraced in the elaborate civilizations of the
Aztecs and Mayans, whom Cortés first encountered?
Finally, there is the reaction from the Indians themselves. The Aztec Empire,
founded in the fourteenth century and building on earlier civilizations in the region,
was the key political power in Mexico and much of Central America. A set of Aztec

accounts provides an unusual insight into initial contacts from the Indian side—
interestingly, the comments refer to the same first encounters that the Cortés
account deals with. The ruler of the vast Aztec empire, Montezuma (Motecuhzoma
in the Aztec account), sent a mission to contact Cortés, and the results are
documented in this passage, along with later observations about some of the
biological impact of the Spanish arrival. Aztec response reflected among other
things an old belief in a beneficent civilizer-god, Quetzalcoatl, who would return
from the east in a particular type of year in the Aztec calendar, which 1519
happened to be. With this document, one set of Indian perceptions of Europeans can
be directly compared with European reactions to the Indians; the same document
suggests the complex mix of factors that explain why the Indian response combined
resistance with various kinds of accommodation.
Questions
1. What were the dominant attitudes of the Europeans? Why did they feel justified in
killing Indians? Were there also “good” Indians, and how were they defined?
2. Why do the accounts of Cortés and Chanca differ? Who were their audiences, and
how might this factor have affected their emphases?
3. Which of the three European accounts was most optimistic about possibilities of
dealing with the Indians, and why?
4. What did the Europeans believe Indian reactions to their arrival were?
5. Which looms larger in the European accounts: religious motivations or greed? Do
the European accounts suggest an early form of racism?
6. How did Cortés treat Indians in Mexico? What were his basic assumptions?
7. Why did some Indians fight and others not? Why did the Aztecs not simply resist
European intrusion in every possible way?
8. What suggestions does the Aztec account offer as to why Spanish conquest
succeeded?
9. How do the Aztec account and the comments of Cortés compare? How do the two
groups evaluate the religious factor? Which side was more aggressive? Which side
had more deeply rooted assumptions of superiority, and why?
For Further Discussion
1. Why were small numbers of Europeans able to conquer the numerous, often wellorganized American peoples?
2. Were European incursions into the Americas one of the great tragedies of world
history?
3. Why might hunting-and-gathering Indians be harder for Europeans to deal with
than those in the civilizations of the Aztecs and the Incas?
SPANISH REACTIONS: CHANCA AND CORTÉS
Dr. Chanca’s comments on Indians came from his experience with the second
Columbus expedition of 1493, which visited various Caribbean islands. Dr. Chanca
was interested in titillating his Spanish readership. Hernando Cortés (1485–1547)
reported to the Spanish royal government from 1519 onward. He had been assigned
an official expedition to Mexico and was able to converse with Indian
representatives through his two interpreters, one a Spaniard previously abandoned in
the Yucatan, one an Indian woman. Cortés used a combination of alliances with

dissident Indian groups and outright fighting to defeat the Aztecs by 1521.

DR. DIEGO ALVAREZ CHANCA ON THE CARIBE INDIANS

The way of life of these caribe people is bestial. There are three islands, this one is
called Turuqueira, the other, which we saw first, is called Ceyre, and the third is
called Ayai. They are all agreed, as if they were of one lineage, doing no harm to
each other. All together they make war on all the other neighbouring islands, going
150 leagues by sea to make raids in the many canoes which they have, which are
small ‘fustas’ made of a single piece of wood. Their arms are arrows rather than iron
weapons, because they do not possess any iron: they fix on points made of tortoiseshell, others from another island fix on fish bones which are jagged, being like that
naturally, like very strong saws, a thing which, for an unarmed people, as they all
are, can kill and do great injury, but for people of our nation are not arms greatly to
be feared.
From Peter Hulme and Noel Whitehead, eds., Wild Majesty: Encounters with Caribes
from Columbia to the Present Day (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), 13–14.
These people raid the other islands and carry off the women whom they can take,
especially the young and beautiful ones, whom they keep to serve them and have
them as concubines, and they carry off so many that in fifty houses nobody was
found, and of the captives more than twenty were young girls. These women also
say that they are treated with a cruelty which seems incredible, for sons whom they
have from them are eaten and they only rear those whom they have from their
native women. The men whom they are able to take, those who are alive they bring
to their houses to butcher for meat, and those who are dead are eaten there and
then. They say that men’s flesh is so good that there is nothing like it in the world,
and it certainly seems so for the bones which we found in these houses had been
gnawed of everything they could gnaw, so that nothing was left on them except
what was much too tough to be eaten. In one house there a man’s neck was found
cooking in a pot. They cut off the male member of the boys they take prisoner and
make use of them until they are men, and then when they want to make a feast, they
kill and eat them, for they say that the flesh of boys and of women is not good to
eat. Of these boys, three came fleeing to us, and all three had had their members cut
off.
CORTÉS IN MEXICO

H. Cortés accordingly left Cuba and began his voyage with ten ships and four
hundred fighting men, among whom were many knights and gentlemen, seventeen
being mounted. The first land they touched was the Island of Cozumel, now called
Santa Cruz, as we mentioned, and on landing at the part of San Juan de Portalatina
the town was found entirely deserted, as if it had never been inhabited. Cortés
wishing to know the cause of such a flight ordered the men to disembark and took
up his abode in the town. It was not long before he learnt from three Indians
captured in a canoe as they were making for the mainland of Yucatán that the chiefs
of the Island at the sight of the Spanish ships approaching had left the town and
retired with all the Indians to the woods and hills, being very afraid of the Spaniards
as not knowing what their intentions might be. Cortés, replying by means of the
native interpreter whom he had with him, informed them he was going to do them
no harm but admonish them and bring them to the knowledge of our Holy Catholic

Faith, that they might become vassals of your Majesty and serve and obey him, as
had all the Indians and peoples of those parts which are already peopled with
Spanish subjects of your Majesties. On the Captain reassuring them in this manner
they lost much of their former fear, and replied that they would willingly inform
their chieftains who had taken refuge in the hills. The Captain thereupon gave them
a letter by which the chiefs might approach in safety and they departed with it
promising to return within the space of five days. After waiting for the reply some
three or four days longer than the allotted time and seeing that they had not
reappeared Cortés decided to search out the coast on either side of him, in order that
the Island should not remain entirely deserted, and accordingly sent out two
captains each with a hundred men, ordering them to proceed to either extremity of
the Island and to hold conversations with any Indians they might meet, telling them
that he was awaiting them in the port of San Juan de Portalatina in order to speak
with them on behalf of your Majesty; such Indians they were to beg and urge as best
they could to come to the said port but were to be careful not to do any harm to
them, in their persons, their houses or their goods, lest the natives should be
rendered more timid and deceitful than they were already. The two captains
departed as they were commanded and returning within four days reported that all
the towns which they had come across were desolate. They brought with them,
however, ten or a dozen people whom they had managed to persuade, among whom
was an Indian chieftain to whom Cortés spoke by means of his interpreter bidding
him go and inform the chiefs that he would in no wise depart from the Island
without seeing and speaking to them. The chieftain agreeing left with the second
letter for the chiefs and two days later returned with the head chief to inform Cortés
that he was the ruler of the Island and was come to see what he wanted. The
Captain informed him that he wished them no harm, but that they should come to
the knowledge of the true faith, and should know that we acknowledged as lords the
greatest princes of the earth and that these in their turn obeyed a greater prince than
he, wherefore what he desired of them was not otherwise than that the chiefs and
Indians of that Island should likewise obey your Majesties, and that doing so they
would be favoured, no-one being able to do them harm. The chief replied that he
was content so to do and sent for all the other chieftains of the Island, who coming
rejoiced greatly at all that the Captain Hernando Cortés had spoken to their chief,
and were reassured in such manner that within a very few days the towns were as
full of people as before, and the Indians went about among us with as little fear as if
they had already had dealings with us for many years.…

Accordingly, as the Captain Hernando Cortés saw that stores were already
beginning to run short and that the men would suffer much from hunger should he
delay there any longer, and the true object of his voyage rest unattained, he decided,
his men agreeing, to depart; and so hoisting sail they left that Island of Cozumel,
now Santa Cruz, very peaceably inclined, so much so that if it were proposed to
found a colony there the natives would be ready without coercion to serve their
Spanish masters. The chiefs in particular were left very contented and at ease with
what the Captain had told them on behalf of your Majesties and with the numerous
articles of finery which he had given them for their own persons. I think there can
be no doubt that all Spaniards who may happen to come to this Island in the future
will be as well received as if they were arriving in a land which had been a long

time colonized. The Island of Cozumel is small, without so much as a single river or
stream; all the water that the Indians drink is from wells. The soil is composed solely
of rocks and stones, a certain portion of it being woody. The Indians’ only produce
is that obtained from bee-keeping, and our procurators are sending to your Majesties
samples both of the land and of the honey for your Majesties’ inspection.
Your Majesties must know that when the Captain told the chiefs in his first
interview with them that they must live no longer in the pagan faith which they held
they begged him to acquaint them with the law under which they were henceforth
to live. The Captain accordingly informed them to the best of his ability in the
Catholic Faith, leaving them a cross of wood which was fixed on a high building and
an image of Our Lady the Virgin Mary, and gave them to understand very fully what
they must do to be good Christians, all of which they manifestly received with very
good will, and so we left them very happy and contented.…
On arriving at the first town we found the Indians in boats drawn up on the shore
near the water.… Early next morning a few Indians approached us in a canoe
bringing several chickens and enough maize to make a meal for a few men and
bidding us accept these and depart from their land. The Captain however spoke to
them through the interpreters giving them to understand that in no wise would he
depart from that land before he had found out the secret of it in order to be able to
send your Majesties a true account, and again begged them not to be offended at his
project nor to deny him entrance for they also were subjects of your Majesties.
However they still forbade us to make a landing and urged us to depart. On their
return to the town the Captain decided to move, and ordered one of his captains to
go with two hundred men by a path which had been discovered during the
preceding night to lead to the village. He himself embarked with some eighty men
on the brigs and boats and took up his position in front of the town ready to land if
they would permit him to do so: even as he approached he found the Indians in war
paint and armed with bows and arrows, lances and small round shields, yelling that
if we would not leave their land and wanted war it should begin at once, for they
were men to defend their own homes. Cortés attempted to speak with them four
times (your Majesties’ notary who accompanied him witnessed to the same to the
effect that he did not desire war) but seeing that it was the determined will of the
Indians to resist his landing and that they were beginning to shoot their arrows
against us, ordered the guns which we carried to be fired and an attack to be made.
Immediately after the discharge of our guns and in the landing which followed a few
of our men were wounded, but finally the fury of our onslaught and the sudden
attack of our comrades who had come up in the rear of the enemy forced them to
fly and abandon the village, which we accordingly took and settled ourselves in
what appeared to be the strongest part of it. In the evening of the following day two
Indians arrived from their chiefs bringing a few very inferior gold ornaments of
small value and told the Captain that they offered him these in order that in
exchange he might leave the land as it was before and do them no hurt. Cortés
replied saying that as to doing them no hurt it pleased him well, but as to leaving
the land they should know that from henceforward they must acknowledge as lords
the greatest princes of the earth and must be their subjects and serve them; by doing
which they would obtain many favours from your Majesties who would help them
and defend them from their enemies. On this they replied that they were content to
do this, but nevertheless still begged him to leave their land, and so we arrived at
friendly terms.
Having patched up this friendship the Captain pointed out that the Spanish troops

who were with him in the village had nothing to eat and had brought nothing from
their ships. He therefore asked them to bring us sufficient food so long as we
remained on land, which they promised to do on the following day, and so departed.
But the next day and another passed without any food arriving so that we were
faced with extreme shortness of provisions, and on the third day a few Spanish
soldiers asked leave of the Captain to visit some of the near-lying farms and see if
they could obtain some food.… Proceeding in this order the vanguard came upon a
large body of Indians who were advancing to attack our camp, so that had we not
gone out to meet them that day it is very possible we should have been hard put to
it. And again the captain of artillery made certain representations (as your notary
can bear witness) to the Indians whom he met in full war paint, crying to them by
means of the native heralds and interpreters that we wanted not war but peace with
them: their only answer was given not in words but in arrows which began to fall
very thickly. The leading party was thus already engaged with the Indians when the
two officers in command of the rearguard came up, and it was not until two hours
later that Cortés arrived in a part of the wood where the Indians were beginning to
encircle the Spaniards in the rear, and there he continued fighting against the
Indians for about an hour; moreover such was their number that neither those
among the Spaniards who were fighting on foot perceived those on horseback nor
knew in what part of the field they were, nor could those on horseback so much as
perceive one another as they surged hither and thither among the Indians. However,
as soon as the Spaniards perceived the horsemen they attacked still more briskly and
almost immediately the Indians were put to flight, the pursuit lasting half a league.
… And so having attended to the wounded and laid them upon stretchers, we
regained our camp taking with us two Indians who were captured there. These
Cortés ordered to be loosed, and sent them with letters to the chieftains telling them
that if they were willing to come to where he was he would pardon them the evil
they had done and would be their friend. Accordingly the very same evening two
Indians who purported to be chieftains arrived, declaring that they were very
grieved at what had occurred and that the chieftains as a body begged him to
pardon them and not punish them further for what was passed nor kill any more of
their people, for over two hundred and twenty Indians had fallen; the past was past
and henceforward they were willing to be subjects of that prince of whom he had
spoken, and such they already held themselves to be, and bound themselves to do
him service whenever anything in your Majesties’ name should be desired of them.
In this wise they sat down and peace was made. The Captain then enquired of
them by the interpreter what people it was who had fought in that battle, and they
replied that tribes from eight provinces had joined together in that place and that
according to the reckoning and lists which they possessed they would be about forty
thousand men, for they could well reckon up to such a number. Thus your Majesties
may truly believe that this battle was won rather by the will of God than by our own
strength, for of what avail are four hundred (and we were no more) against forty
thousand warriors?
FRENCH REACTIONS: CHAMPLAIN
Samuel de Champlain (1567–1635), was the chief French explorer in North America
and a key founder of New France, in Canada. He made his first fur-trading
expedition to the region in 1603 and subsequently participated in a number of other
expeditions, sometimes joining in attacks on the Iroquois Indians by the Huron tribe.
He wrote accounts of his travels in several editions, with a definitive edition

completed in exile (during a period when the English had conquered New France) in
1632. In his later years, both before and after the English disruption, he served as
virtual governor of New France, and he was buried in Quebec.

FRENCH ENCOUNTERS IN NORTH AMERICA

Now I will drop this discussion to return to the savages who had conducted me to
the falls of the river Norumbegue, who went to notify Bessabez, their chief, and
other savages, who in turn proceeded to another little river to inform their own,
named Cabahis, and give him notice of our arrival.
From Voyages of Samuel de Champlain, 1604–1618, ed. W. L. Grant (New York:
Charles Scribner’s, 1907), 49–50, 71–74, 97–100.
The 16th of the month there came to us some thirty savages on assurances given
them by those who had served us as guides. There came also to us the same day the
above-named Bessabez with six canoes. As soon as the savages who were on land
saw him coming, they all began to sing, dance, and jump, until he had landed.
Afterwards, they all seated themselves in a circle on the ground, as is their custom,
when they wish to celebrate a festivity, or an harangue is to be made. Cabahis, the
other chief, arrived also a little later with twenty or thirty of his companions, who
withdrew to one side and greatly enjoyed seeing us, as it was the first time they had
seen Christians. A little while after, I went on shore with two of my companions and
two of our savages who served as interpreters. I directed the men in our barque to
approach near the savages, and hold their arms in readiness to do their duty in case
they noticed any movement of these people against us. Bessabez, seeing us on land,
bade us sit down, and began to smoke with his companions, as they usually do
before an address. They presented us with venison and game.
I directed our interpreter to say to our savages that they should cause Bessabez,
Cabahis, and their companions to understand that Sieur de Monts had sent me to
them to see them, and also their country, and that he desired to preserve friendship
with them and to reconcile them with their enemies, the Souriquois and Canadians,
and moreover that he desired to inhabit their country and show them how to
cultivate it, in order that they might not continue to lead so miserable a life as they
were doing, and some other words on the same subject. This our savages interpreted
to them, at which they signified their great satisfaction, saying that no greater good
could come to them than to have our friendship, and that they desired to live in
peace with their enemies, and that we should dwell in their land, in order that they
might in future more than ever before engage in hunting beavers, and give us a part
of them in return for our providing them with things which they wanted. After he
had finished his discourse, I presented them with hatchets, paternosters, caps, knives,
and other little knickknacks, when we separated from each other. All the rest of this
day and the following night, until break of day, they did nothing but dance, sing,
and make merry, after which we traded for a certain number of beavers. Then each
party returned, Bessabez with his companions on the one side, and we on the other,
highly pleased at having made the acquaintance of this people.…
On the 23d of July, four or five seamen having gone on shore with some kettles to
get fresh water, which was to be found in one of the sand-banks a short distance
from our barque, some of the savages, coveting them, watched the time when our
men went to the spring, and then seized one out of the hands of a sailor, who was
the first to dip, and who had no weapons. One of his companions, starting to run

after him, soon returned, as he could not catch him, since he ran much faster than
himself. The other savages, of whom there were a large number, seeing our sailors
running to our barque, and at the same time shouting to us to fire at them, took to
flight. At the time there were some of them in our barque, who threw themselves
into the sea, only one of whom we were able to seize. Those on the land who had
taken to flight, seeing them swimming, returned straight to the sailor from whom
they had taken away the kettle, hurled several arrows at him from behind, and
brought him down. Seeing this, they ran at once to him, and despatched him with
their knives. Meanwhile, haste was made to go on shore, and muskets were fired
from our barque: mine, bursting in my hands, came near killing me. The savages,
hearing this discharge of fire-arms, took to flight, and with redoubled speed when
they saw that we had landed, for they were afraid when they saw us running after
them. There was no likelihood of our catching them, for they are as swift as horses.
We brought in the murdered man, and he was buried some hours later. Meanwhile,
we kept the prisoner bound by the feet and hands on board of our barque, fearing
that he might escape. But Sieur de Monts resolved to let him go, being persuaded
that he was not to blame, and that he had no previous knowledge of what had
transpired, as also those who, at the time, were in and about our barque. Some
hours later there came some savages to us, to excuse themselves, indicating by signs
and demonstrations that it was not they who had committed this malicious act, but
others farther off in the interior. We did not wish to harm them, although it was in
our power to avenge ourselves.
All these savages from the Island Cape wear neither robes nor furs, except very
rarely: moreover, their robes are made of grasses and hemp, scarcely covering the
body, and coming down only to their thighs. They have only the sexual parts
concealed with a small piece of leather; so likewise the women, with whom it comes
down a little lower behind than with the men, all the rest of the body being naked.
Whenever the women came to see us, they wore robes which were open in front. The
men cut off the hair on the top of the head like those at the river Choüacoet. I saw,
among other things, a girl with her hair very neatly dressed, with a skin colored red,
and bordered on the upper part with little shellbeads. A part of her hair hung down
behind, the rest being braided in various ways. These people paint the face red,
black, and yellow. They have scarcely any beard, and tear it out as fast as it grows.
Their bodies are well-proportioned. I cannot tell what government they have, but I
think that in this respect they resemble their neighbors, who have none at all. They
know not how to worship or pray; yet, like the other savages, they have some
superstitions, which I shall describe in their place. As for weapons, they have only
pikes, clubs, bows and arrows. It would seem from their appearance that they have a
good disposition, better than those of the north, but they are all in fact of no great
worth. Even a slight intercourse with them gives you at once a knowledge of them.
They are great thieves and, if they cannot lay hold of any thing with their hands,
they try to do so with their feet, as we have oftentimes learned by experience. I am
of opinion that, if they had any thing to exchange with us, they would not give
themselves to thieving. They bartered away to us their bows, arrows, and quivers,
for pins and buttons; and if they had had any thing else better they would have done
the same with it. It is necessary to be on one’s guard against this people, and live in
a state of distrust of them, yet without letting them perceive it. They gave us a large
quantity of tobacco, which they dry and then reduce to powder. When they eat
Indian corn, they boil it in earthen pots, which they make in a way different from
ours. They bray it also in wooden mortars and reduce it to flour, of which they then
make cakes, like the Indians of Peru.…

Now, in view of what Sieur de Poutrincourt had seen, and the order which it had
been told him they observed when they wished to play some bad trick, when we
passed by some cabins, where there was a large number of women, we gave them
some bracelets and rings to keep them quiet and free from fear, and to most of the
old and distinguished men hatchets, knives, and other things which they desired.
This pleased them greatly, and they repaid it all in dances, gambols, and harangues,
which we did not understand at all. We went wherever we chose without their
having the assurance to say anything to us. It pleased us greatly to see them show
themselves so simple in appearance.…
The next day, in the morning, the 15th of October, the savages did not fail to
come and see in what condition our men were, whom they found asleep, except one,
who was near the fire. When they saw them in this condition, they came, to the
number of four hundred, softly over a little hill, and sent them such a volley of
arrows that to rise up was death. Fleeing the best they could towards our barque,
shouting, “Help! they are killing us!” a part fell dead in the water; the others were all
pierced with arrows, and one died in consequence a short time after. The savages
made a desperate noise with roarings, which it was terrible to hear.
Upon the occurrence of this noise and that of our men, the sentinel, on our vessel,
exclaimed, “To arms! They are killing our men!” Consequently, each one
immediately seized his arms; and we embarked in the shallop, some fifteen or
sixteen of us, in order to go ashore. But, being unable to get there on account of a
sandbank between us and the land, we threw ourselves into the water, and waded
from this bank to the shore, the distance of a musket-shot. As soon as we were there,
the savages, seeing us within arrow range, fled into the interior. To pursue them was
fruitless, for they are marvellously swift. All that we could do was to carry away the
dead bodies and bury them near a cross, which had been set up the day before, and
then to go here and there to see if we could get sight of any of them. But it was time
wasted, therefore we came back. Three hours afterwards, they returned to us on the
sea-shore. We discharged at them several shots from our little brass cannon; and,
when they heard the noise, they crouched down on the ground to avoid the fire. In
mockery of us, they beat down the cross and disinterred the dead, which displeased
us greatly, and caused us to go for them a second time; but they fled, as they had
done before. We set up again the cross, and reinterred the dead, whom they had
thrown here and there amid the heath, where they kindled a fire to burn them. We
returned without any result, as we had done before, well aware that there was
scarcely hope of avenging ourselves this time, and that we should have to renew the
undertaking when it should please God.
AZTEC REACTIONS: THE BROKEN SPEARS
The Broken Spears is a compilation of a number of Aztec and other Indian records
from the sixteenth century, assembled in the 1960s by a Spanish scholar. The
materials include codices originally written in the Nahuat language (one of the
Aztec-stem languages) that escaped the general Spanish destruction of nativelanguage documents, plus later recollections written by Indians in Spanish. The
reassembly of the materials in rough chronological order, by the book’s editor,
permits unique insight into one whole side of this fateful encounter.
•••
Then Motecuhzoma gave the messengers his final orders. He said to them: “Go now,
without delay. Do reverence to our lord the god. Say to him: ‘Your deputy,

Motecuhzoma, has sent us to you. Here are the presents with which he welcomes
you home to Mexico.’” …
One by one they did reverence to Cortes by touching the ground before him with
their lips. They said to him: “If the god will deign to hear us, your deputy
Motecuhzoma has sent us to render you homage. He has the City of Mexico in his
care. He says: ‘The god is weary.’”
Then they arrayed the Captain in the finery they had brought him as presents.
With great care they fastened the turquoise mask in place, the mask of the god with
its crossband of quetzal feathers. A golden earring hung down on either side of this
mask. They dressed him in the decorated vest and the collar woven in the petatillo
style—-the collar of chalchihuites, with a disk of gold in the center.
Next they fastened the mirror to his hips, dressed him in the cloak known as “the
ringing bell” and adorned his feet. … In his hand they placed the shield with its
fringe and pendant of quetzal feathers, its ornaments of gold and mother-of-pearl.
Finally they set before him the pair of black sandals. As for the other objects of
divine finery, they only laid them out for him to see.
The Captain asked them: “And is this all? Is this your gift of welcome? Is this how
you greet people?”
They replied: “This is all, our lord. This is what we have brought you.”
Then the Captain gave orders, and the messengers were chained by the feet and by
the neck. When this had been done, the great cannon was fired off. The messengers
lost their senses and fainted away. They fell down side by side and lay where they
had fallen. But the Spaniards quickly revived them: they lifted them up, gave them
wine to drink and then offered them food.

The Captain said to them: “I have heard that the Mexicans are very great warriors,
very brave and terrible. If a Mexican is fighting alone, he knows how to retreat, turn
back, rush forward and conquer, even if his opponents are ten or even twenty. But
my heart is not convinced. I want to see it for myself. I want to find out if you are
truly that strong and brave.”
Then he gave them swords, spears and leather shields. He said: “It will take place
very early, at daybreak. We are going to fight each other in pairs, and in this way we
will learn the truth. We will see who falls to the ground!”
They said to the Captain: “Our lord, we were not sent here for this by your deputy
Motecuhzoma! We have come on an exclusive mission, to offer you rest and repose
and to bring you presents. What the lord desires is not within our warrant. If we
were to do this, it might anger Motecuhzoma, and he would surely put us to
death.”…
Then they left in great haste and continued to the City of Mexico. They entered
the city at night, in the middle of the night.
The messengers went to the House of the Serpent, and Motecuhzoma arrived. The
two captives were then sacrificed before his eyes: their breasts were torn open, and
the messengers were sprinkled with their blood. This was done because the
messengers had completed a difficult mission: they had seen the gods, their eyes had
looked on their faces. They had even conversed with the gods!

When the sacrifice was finished, the messengers reported to the king. They told
him how they had made the journey, and what they had seen, and what food the
strangers ate. Motecuhzoma was astonished and terrified by their report, and the
description of the strangers’ food astonished him above all else.
He was also terrified to learn how the cannon roared, how its noise resounded,
how it caused one to faint and grow deaf. The messengers told him: “A thing like a
ball of stone comes out of its entrails: it comes out shooting sparks and raining fire.
The smoke that comes out with it has a pestilent odor, like that of rotten mud. This
odor penetrates even to the brain and causes the greatest discomfort. If the cannon
is aimed against a mountain, the mountain splits and cracks open. If it is aimed
against a tree, it shatters the tree into splinters. This is a most unnatural sight, as if
the tree had exploded from within.”
The messengers also said: “Their trappings and arms are all made of iron. They
dress in iron and wear iron casques on their heads. Their swords are iron; their bows
are iron; their shields are iron; their spears are iron. Their deer carry them on their
backs wherever they wish to go. These deer, our lord, are as tall as the roof of a
house.
“The strangers’ bodies are completely covered, so that only their faces can be
seen. Their skin is white, as if it were made of lime. They have yellow hair, though
some of them have black. Their beards are long and yellow, and their moustaches
are also yellow. Their hair is curly, with very fine strands.
“As for their food, it is like human food. It is large and white, and not heavy. It is
something like straw, but with the taste of a cornstalk, of the pith of a cornstalk. It
is a little sweet, as if it were flavored with honey; it tastes of honey, it is sweettasting food.…
When Motecuhzoma heard this report, he was filled with terror. It was as if his
heart had fainted, as if it had shriveled. It was as if he were conquered by despair.
While the Spaniards were in Tlaxcala, a great plague broke out here in
Tenochtitlan [the Aztec capital, now Mexico City]. It began to spread during the
thirteenth month and lasted for seventy days, striking everywhere in the city and
killing a vast number of our people. Sores erupted on our faces, our breasts, our
bellies; we were covered with agonizing sores from head to foot.
The illness was so dreadful that no one could walk or move. The sick were so
utterly helpless that they could only lie on their beds like corpses, unable to move
their limbs or even their heads. They could not lie face down or roll from one side to
the other. If they did move their bodies, they screamed with pain.
A great many died from this plague, and many others died of hunger. They could
not get up to search for food, and everyone else was too sick to care for them, so
they starved to death in their beds.
Some people came down with a milder form of the disease; they suffered less than
the others and made a good recovery. But they could not escape entirely. Their looks
were ravaged, for wherever a sore broke out, it gouged an ugly pockmark in the
skin. And a few of the survivors were left completely blind.

CHAPTER 17
THE SPREAD OF SLAVERY AND THE ATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE
Atlantic history, as a category, is gaining increasing attention. The ocean became a
world trade artery for the first time in the fifteenth century. More important were
the human connections formed, as peoples from both sides of the Atlantic, and from
north and south, interacted in various ways. New creativity and new suffering both
resulted.
This chapter deals with the unprecedented transatlantic trade in African slaves,
which began in the sixteenth century and continued for three hundred years. This
trade had a host of impacts in world history and in the development of all the
regions involved.
The capture and purchase of millions of Africans, who were sent as slaves to
South and North America and the Caribbean by European slave traders from the
sixteenth century until the early nineteenth, mainly for plantation work, constitute
one of the key episodes of early modern world history. The result weakened internal
trade balance and population size in West Africa, though individual merchants and
rulers benefited. The profits helped fuel Europe’s commercial economy. The spread
of slavery and the impact of diverse African cultures left durable marks on the
Americas.
Slavery was an old institution. Most river valley civilizations had held slaves,
often captives in war. Greek and Roman societies had depended heavily on slaves,
who provided domestic service but also did vital, brutal work in mines and on
agricultural estates. Roman use of slaves for agricultural labor indeed provided the
clearest prior precedent for the new slavery of the early modern period. Slavery also
existed within Africa, again involving captures in war and the ensuing hereditary
status of their descendants. Though the numbers of slaves were relatively small,
Africa obviously contained a preestablished group of slave merchants.
Nevertheless, the volume, speed, and displacement of the new transatlantic slave
trade had no precedent. Europeans in the Americas hoped to find gold and other
easy wealth. In fact, they discovered the profitability of some mining and also
export agricultural production. Yet local labor was scarce, in large part because the
majority of the American Indian population died off in contact with European
diseases. Africa, newly explored by European voyagers, seemed to provide the
answer, in a context where Europeans now ruled the seas.
Here, clearly, was a radically new international contact, which affected Europe,
Africa, and the Americas. The impact on Africa has been much debated. Population
loss and diversion of trade away from the Muslim world, as transatlantic commerce
replaced trans-Saharan, definitely made a difference. On the other hand, strong
governments persisted in Africa, as did older cultural forms. Europe was most
obviously affected by the money its merchants made, which increased wealth and
capital—helping to fuel further economic change, including ultimately the industrial
revolution. More subtly, European views of Africans, though not yet as thoroughly
racist as they would become in the nineteenth century, became hardened in ways
that still affect world history. The massive new labor force in the Americas enhanced
the ability to generate exports such as sugar for the world economy. Africans also
brought their cultures and their experience of the slave voyage and of slavery itself,

which would contribute vital ingredients to the history of the Americas from this
time onward.
Finally, of course, there was the impact on the slaves themselves, for whom this
was an unquestionably dreadful experience. Deaths and mistreatment on the slave
ships were compounded by harsh treatment in the Americas—though there were
different levels of awfulness. The fear and indignity of the experience affected
surviving slaves more perhaps than the physical torment. Here, too, were important
ingredients of early modern world history that would have ongoing impacts on the
large African American minorities in the Caribbean and on both American
continents.
In the following selections, a European slave trader presents his observations,
indirectly highlighting some of the attitudes that would allow him to accept his
active commercial role. Then, from a hundred years later, in the eighteenth century,
an African former slave presents his view of the same process. We are able to
juxtapose two different vantage points, that of the actors and that of the acted upon,
to determine how they evaluated the same basic historical process and what larger
consequences their perspectives suggest.
The slave trade constitutes one of those common events with at least two
radically different sides, the winners and the losers. Comparison can help sort out
what really happened, while sharpening the analysis of the experience of both
parties.
Questions
1. What did Europeans offer Africans in the slave trade? How were slaves obtained
from the African interior? Do Barbot and Equiano agree on the methods used?
2. Why were European traders so nonchalant about their own involvement, and so
willing to be involved?
3. What impact did Europeans think they were having on Africa itself, including
African states and rulers?
4. How did Christianity interact with the slave trade? Does Barbot reflect Christian
criteria in his slave trader account?
5. Were the European traders aware of slaves as humans? Could they distinguish
good from bad treatment? How did they understand and deal with the reactions of
slaves themselves to the experience of capture and trade?
6. Are there any similarities between European and African descriptions of the
trade? How did Africans react to European technology and material culture? What
was the role of beliefs in magic? Did Africans have the fears of Europeans that the
slave traders claimed? What motives did they ascribe to Europeans?
7. Slave traders and slaves both were potentially partisan. Does either of the
following accounts seem exaggerated? Does Barbot show any signs of distorting
his descriptions to make himself look good, or does he not believe he has to
bother? Does Equiano exaggerate problems or ignore benefits?
For Further Discussion
1. Which account most helps you to understand the slave trade and the experiences
involved? Which is more informative? Which provides the better basis for
assessing the effects of the slave trade?
2. Judging by Barbot’s discussion, were slave traders racist? Scholars debate whether

Western racism helped cause the European treatment of slaves or was a result of
it. What does Barbot’s account suggest? Is this a useful question for the early
modern period?
3. What impact would the trade and the passage across the Atlantic have in the later
lives of the slaves and their descendants? Does either of the accounts in this
chapter suggest probable impacts?
4. What was different about slavery and the slave trade in the Americas from more
traditional forms of slavery? What accounts for the differences?
THE SLAVE TRADER’S VIEW: JOHN BARBOT
John Barbot was an employee of a French slave trading company. He made several
trips to West Africa in the 1670s and 1680s. His account is unusually detailed,
suggesting an active intellect, whatever his other attributes were. And he clearly
harbored some internal ambivalence about the treatment he saw and participated in
—though it’s possible to argue that he did almost nothing about his qualms.

Goods for Trade

…the French import common red, blue, and scarlet cloth, silver and brass rings, or
bracelets, chains, little bells, false crystal, ordinary and coarse hats; Dutch pointed
knives, pewter dishes, silk sashes, with false gold and silver fringes; blue serges,
French paper, steels to strike fire… brass kettles, yellow amber, maccatons, that is,
beads of two sorts, pieces of eight of the old stamp, some silver pieces of 28 sols
value, either plain or gilt, Dutch cutlaces, strait and bow’d, clouts, galet, martosdes,
two other sorts of beads, of which the Blacks make necklaces for women, white
sugar, musket balls, iron nails, shot, white and red frize, looking-glasses in gilt and
plain frames, cloves, cinnamon, scissors, needles, coarse thread of sundry colours,
but chiefly red, yellow, and white. … Particularly at Goeree, the company imports
ten thousand or more every year, of those which are made in the province of
Brittany, all short and thin, which is called in London narrow flat iron, or half flat
iron of Sweden; but each bar shortened, or cut off at one end to about 16 or 18
inches, so that about eighty of these bars weigh a ton, or twenty hundred weight
English. It is to be observ’d, that such voyage-iron, as called in London, is the only
sort and size used throughout all Nigritia, Guinea, and West-Ethiopia, in the way of
trade. Lastly, a good quantity of Coignac brandy, both in hogsheads and rundlets,
single and double, the double being eight, the single four gallons.
The principal goods the French have in return for these commodities from the
Moors and Blacks, are slaves, gold-dust, elephants teeth, bees-wax, dry and green
hides, gum-arabick, ostrich feathers, and several other odd things.…
The French have built a small fort, mounted with eight guns. … There they buy
slaves in considerable numbers… which they convey down to their factory every
year.…
The country of little Brak affords them slaves.…
At the villages of Bozaert, or Bozar, and Caye, near the factory they have slaves.…
Slaves

Those sold by the Blacks are for the most part prisoners of war, taken either in fight,
or pursuit, or in the incursions they make into their enemies’ territories; others
stolen away by their own countrymen; and some there are, who will sell their own
children, kindred, or neighbours. This has been often seen, and to compass it, they
desire the person they intend to sell, to help them in carrying something to the
factory by way of trade, and when there, the person so deluded, not understanding
the language, is sold and deliver’d up as a slave, notwithstanding all his resistance,
and exclaiming against the treachery. I was told of one, who design’d to sell his own
son, after that manner; but he understanding French, dissembled for a while, and
then contriv’d it so cunningly as to persuade the French, that the old man was his
slave, and not his father, by which means he deliver’d him up into captivity; and
thus made good the Italian Proverb, A furbo furbo e mezzo; amounting to as much
as, Set a thief to catch a thief, or Diamond cuts Diamond. However, it happened
soon after, that the fellow was met by some of the principal Blacks of the country,
as he was returning home from the factory, with the goods he had receiv’d for the
sale of his father, all which they took away, and order’d him to be sold for a slave.
The kings are so absolute, that upon any slight pretence of offences committed by
their subjects, they order them to be sold for slaves, without regard to rank, or
possession. Thus a Marabout, or Priest, as I believe, was sold to me at Goeree, by the
Alcaide of Rio Fresco, by special order of king Damel, for some misdemeanors. I
took notice, that this Priest was above two months aboard the ship, before he would
speak one word.…
Abundance of little Blacks of both sexes are also stolen away by their neighbours,
when found abroad on the roads, or in the woods; or else in the Cougans, or
cornfields, at the time of the year, when their parents keep them there all day, to
scare away the devouring small birds, that come to feed on the millet, in swarms, as
has been said above.
In times of dearth and famine, abundance of those people will sell themselves, for
a maintenance, and to prevent starving. When I first arriv’d at Goeree, in December,
1681, I could have bought a great number, at very easy rates, if I could have found
provisions to subsist them; so great was the dearth then, in that part of Nigritia.
To conclude, some slaves are also brought to these Blacks, from very remote
inland countries, by way of trade, and sold for things of very inconsiderable value;
but these slaves are generally poor and weak, by reason of the barbarous usage they
have had in traveling so far, being continually beaten, and almost famish’d; so
inhuman are the Blacks to one another.…
The great wealth of the Fantineans [Fantyn, a West African country] makes them
so proud and haughty, that an European trading there must stand bare to them. … A
good slave sells there, as at all other trading places on the Gold-Coast westward, at
the rate of one Benda of gold, which is two ounces.…
In time of war, it [Accra] furnishes so great a number of slaves, that it amounts
to, at least, as many as are sold all along the rest of the coast. This country is
continually in war with some of the neighbouring nations, which are very populous,
and from whom they take very many prisoners, most of whom, they sell to the
Europeans. The slaves are commonly purchased for coesvelt linen, slyziger, lywat,
sheets, sayes, perpetuanas, firelocks, powder, brandy, bugles, knives, top-sails,
nicannees, and other goods, according to the times. The natives carry those
commodities to Abonee market, which is four leagues beyond Great Acra northward,
for the Accanez people, who resort thither three times a week; as do other Blacks

from the country of Abonee, Aquamboe, and Aquimera, who all buy those goods of
the Acra men, at such rates as they think fit to put upon them, the king refusing to
permit those strangers to go down themselves to the European warehouses on the
coast; for which reason, those Blacks pay often double the value for what they buy.
The king has there an overseer, who has the power to set the price on all goods,
between buyer and seller. This general overseer is assisted by several officers to act
for him, where he cannot be present himself. Those employments are much sought
after there, as being both honourable and advantageous; because, both the king’s
and their perquisites are very considerable.…
The king and chief Blacks of Acra were, in my time, very rich in slaves and gold,
through the vast trade the natives drove with the Europeans on the coast, and the
neighbouring nations up the country.…
The trade of slaves is in a more peculiar manner the business of kings, rich men,
and prime merchants, exclusive of the inferior sort of Blacks.
These slaves are severely and barbarously treated by their masters, who subsist
them poorly, and beat them inhumanly, as may be seen by the scabs and wounds on
the bodies of many of them when sold to us. They scarce allow them the least rag to
cover their nakedness, which they also take off from them when sold to Europeans;
and they always go bare-headed. The wives and children of slaves, are also slaves to
the master under whom they are married; and when dead, they never bury them, but
cast out the bodies into some by place, to be devoured by birds, or beasts of prey.
This barbarous usage of those unfortunate wretches, makes it appear, that the fate
of such as are bought, and transported from the coast to America, or other parts of
the world, by Europeans, is less deplorable, than that of those who end their days in
their native country; for aboard ships all possible care is taken to preserve and
subsist them for the interest of the owners, and when sold in America, the same
motive ought to prevail with their masters to use them well, that they may live the
longer, and do them more service. Not to mention the inestimable advantage they
may reap, of becoming christians, and saving their souls, if they make a true use of
their condition.…
I also remember, that I once, among my several runs along that coast, happened
to have aboard a whole family, man, wife, three young boys, and a girl, bought one
after another, at several places; and cannot but observe here, what mighty
satisfaction those poor creatures expressed to be so come together again, tho’ in
bondage. For several days successively they could not forbear shedding tears of joy,
and continually embracing and caressing one another; which moving me to
compassion, I ordered they should be better treated aboard than commonly we can
afford to do it, where there are four or five hundred in a ship; and at Martinico, I
sold them all together to a considerable planter, at a cheaper rate than I might have
expected, had they been disposed of severally; being informed of that gentleman’s
good-nature, and having taken his word, that he would use that family as well as
their circumstances would permit, and settle them in some part by themselves.
I have elsewhere spoke of the manner of valuing and rating the slaves among the
Blacks, and shall conclude this chapter, which proves to be one of the longest, with
an odd remark; which is, That many of those slaves we transport from Guinea to
America are prepossessed with the opinion, that they are carried like sheep to the
slaughter, and that the Europeans are fond of their flesh; which notion so far
prevails with some, as to make them fall into a deep melancholy and despair, and to
refuse all sustenance, tho’ never so much compelled and even beaten to oblige them

to take some nourishment: notwithstanding all which, they will starve to death;
whereof I have had several instances in my own slaves both aboard and at
Guadalupe. And tho’ I must say I am naturally compassionate, yet have I been
necessitated sometimes to cause the teeth of those wretches to be broken, because
they would not open their mouths, or be prevailed upon by any intreaties to feed
themselves; and thus have forced some sustenance into their throats.…
As the slaves come down to Fida from the inland country, they are put into a
booth, or prison, built for that purpose, near the beach, all of them together; and
when the Europeans are to receive them, they are brought out into a large plain,
where the surgeons examine every part of every one of them, to the smallest
member, men and women being all stark naked. Such as are allowed good and
sound, are set on one side, and the others by themselves; which slaves so rejected are
there called Mackrons, being above thirty five years of age, or defective in their
limbs, eyes or teeth; or grown grey, or that have the venereal disease, or any other
imperfection. These being so set aside, each of the others, which have passed as
good, is marked on the breast, with a red-hot iron, imprinting the mark of the
French, English, or Dutch companies, that so each nation may distinguish their own,
and to prevent their being chang’d by the natives for worse, as they are apt enough
to do. In this particular, care is taken that the women, as tenderest, be not burnt too
hard.…
If there happens to be no stock of slaves at Fida, the factor must trust the Blacks
with his goods, to the value of a hundred and fifty, or two hundred slaves; which
goods they carry up into the inland, to buy slaves, at all the markets, for above two
hundred leagues up the country, where they are kept like cattle in Europe; the slaves
sold there being generally prisoners of war, taken from their enemies, like other
booty, and perhaps some few sold by their own countrymen, in extreme want, or
upon a famine; as also some as a punishment of heinous crimes: tho’ many
Europeans believe that parents sell their own children, men their wives and
relations, which, if it ever happens, is so seldom, that it cannot justly be charged
upon a whole nation, as a custom and common practice.…
As to the slaves, and the trade of them, whereof I have before spoke at large, it
will be proper to observe here, that commonly the slaves we purchase at Fida and
Ardra, are brought down to the coast from several countries, two and three hundred
leagues up the inland; where the inhabitants are lusty, strong, and very laborious
people: thence it is, that tho’ they are not so black and fine to look at as the NorthGuinea and Gold-Coast Blacks, yet are they fitter for the American plantations, than
any others; especially in the sugar islands, where they require more labour and
strength than in the other colonies of Europeans, at which the Fida and Ardra slaves
are found, by constant experience, to hold out much longer, and with less detriment
to themselves, than the other slaves transported thither from the other
abovementioned parts of Guinea. One thing is to be taken notice of by sea-faring
men, that these Fida and Ardra slaves are of all the others, the most apt to revolt
aboard ships, by a conspiracy carried on amongst themselves; especially such as are
brought down to Fida, from very remote inland countries, who easily draw others
into their plot: for being used to see men’s flesh eaten in their own country, and
publick markets held for that purpose, they are very full of the notion, that we buy
and transport them to the same purpose; and will therefore watch all opportunities
to deliver themselves, by assaulting a ship’s crew, and murdering them all, if
possible: whereof, we have almost every year some instances, in one European ship
or other, that is filled with slaves.

THE AFRICAN SLAVE EXPERIENCE: OLAUDAH EQUIANO
Most slaves, needless to say, had no opportunity to write about their experience.
Olaudah Equiano’s account is unusual because of its existence, but the experience
reported is not necessarily unusual. Equiano was born in a Nigerian village, Isseke,
in 1745. He was kidnapped and in 1756 taken to Barbados and then to Virginia.
Finally able to buy his freedom from his Quaker master, he went to England in 1767.
He became active in the antislavery movement, publishing his memoirs in 1788 as a
protest against the whole institution of slavery. His writings were among the first
antislavery books by an ex-slave.
•••
My father, besides many slaves, had a numerous family, of which seven lived to
grow up, including myself and sister, who was the only daughter. As I was the
youngest of the sons, I became, of course, the greatest favorite with my mother, and
was always with her; and she used to take particular pains to form my mind. I was
trained up from my earliest years in the art of war: my daily exercise was shooting
and throwing javelins, and my mother adorned me with emblems, after the manner
of our greatest warriors. In this way I grew up till I had turned the age of eleven,
when an end was put to my happiness in the following manner.…
From The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, ed. Robert J. Allison
(Boston: Bedford Books, 1995), 46–58. (Follows the first American printing [New
York, 1791]). Includes modernized spelling.
One day, when all our people were gone out to their works as usual, and only I
and my dear sister were left to mind the house, two men and a woman got over our
walls, and in a moment seized us both, and, without giving us time to cry out, or
make resistance, they stopped our mouths, and ran off with us into the nearest
wood. Here they tied our hands, and continued to carry us as far as they could, till
night came on, when we reached a small house, where the robbers halted for
refreshment, and spent the night. We were then unbound, but were unable to take
any food; and, being quite overpowered by fatigue and grief, our only relief was
some sleep, which allayed our misfortune for a short time. The next morning we left
the house, and continued travelling all the day. For a long time we had kept the
woods, but at last we came into a road which I believed I knew. I had now some
hopes of being delivered; for we had advanced but a little way before I discovered
some people at a distance, on which I began to cry out for their assistance; but my
cries had no other effect than to make them tie me faster and stop my mouth, and
then they put me into a large sack. They also stopped my sister’s mouth, and tied her
hands; and in this manner we proceeded till we were out of sight of these people.
When we went to rest the following night, they offered us some victuals, but we
refused it; and the only comfort we had was in being in one another’s arms all that
night, and bathing each other with our tears. But alas! we were soon deprived of
even the small comfort of weeping together.
The next day proved a day of greater sorrow than I had yet experienced; for my
sister and I were then separated, while we lay clasped in each other’s arms. It was in
vain that we besought them not to part us; she was torn from me, and immediately
carried away, while I was left in a state of distraction not to be described.
From the time I left my own nation, I always found somebody that understood
me till I came to the sea coast. The languages of different nations did not totally
differ, nor were they so copious as those of the Europeans, particularly the English.

They were therefore easily learned; and, while I was journeying thus through Africa,
I acquired two or three different tongues.…
The first object which saluted my eyes when I arrived on the coast, was the sea,
and a slave ship, which was then riding at anchor, and waiting for its cargo. These
filled me with astonishment, which was soon converted into terror, when I was
carried on board. I was immediately handled, and tossed up to see if I were sound,
by some of the crew; and I was now persuaded that I had gotten into a world of bad
spirits, and that they were going to kill me. Their complexions, too, differing so
much from ours, their long hair, and the language they spoke (which was very
different from any I had ever heard), united to confirm me in this belief. Indeed,
such were the horrors of my views and fears at the moment, that, if ten thousand
worlds had been my own, I would have freely parted with them all to have
exchanged my condition with that of the meanest slave in my own country. When I
looked round the ship too, and saw a large furnace of copper boiling, and a
multitude of black people of every description chained together, every one of their
countenances expressing dejection and sorrow, I no longer doubted of my fate; and,
quite overpowered with horror and anguish, I fell motionless on the deck and
fainted. When I recovered a little, I found some black people about me, who I
believed were some of those who had brought me on board, and had been receiving
their pay; they talked to me in order to cheer me, but all in vain. I asked them if we
were not to be eaten by those white men with horrible looks, red faces, and long
hair. They told me I was not.…
I now saw myself deprived of all chance of returning to my native country, or
even the least glimpse of hope of gaining the shore, which I now considered as
friendly; and I even wished for my former slavery in preference to my present
situation, which was filled with horrors of every kind, still heightened by my
ignorance of what I was to undergo. I was not long suffered to indulge my grief; I
was soon put down under the decks, and there I received such a salutation in my
nostrils as I had never experienced in my life: so that, with the loathsomeness of the
stench, and crying together, I became so sick and low that I was not able to eat, nor
had I the least desire to taste anything. I now wished for the last friend, death, to
relieve me; but soon, to my grief, two of the white men offered me eatables; and, on
my refusing to eat, one of them held me fast by the hands, and laid me across, I
think, the windlass, and tied my feet, while the other flogged me severely. I had
never experienced anything of this kind before, and, although not being used to the
water, I naturally feared that element the first time I saw it, yet, nevertheless, could I
have got over the nettings, I would have jumped over the side, but I could not; and
besides, the crew used to watch us very closely who were not chained down to the
decks, lest we should leap into the water; and I have seen some of these poor African
prisoners most severely cut, for attempting to do so, and hourly whipped for not
eating. This indeed was often the case with myself.
In a little time after, amongst the poor chained men, I found some of my own
nation, which in a small degree gave ease to my mind. I inquired of these what was
to be done with us? They gave me to understand, we were to be carried to these
white people’s country to work for them. I then was a little revived, and thought, if
it were no worse than working, my situation was not so desperate; but still I feared I
should be put to death, the white people looked and acted, as I thought, in so savage
a manner; for I had never seen among any people such instances of brutal cruelty;
and this not only shown towards us blacks, but also to some of the whites
themselves. One white man in particular I saw, when we were permitted to be on

deck, flogged so unmercifully with a large rope near the foremast, that he died in
consequence of it; and they tossed him over the side as they would have done a
brute. This made me fear these people the more; and I expected nothing less than to
be treated in the same manner. I could not help expressing my fears and
apprehensions to some of my countrymen; I asked them if these people had no
country, but lived in this hollow place (the ship)?
They told me they did not, but came from a distant one. “Then,” said I, “how comes
it in all our country we never heard of them?” They told me because they lived so
very far off. … I therefore wished much to be [away] from …them, for I expected
they would sacrifice me; but my wishes were vain—for we were so quartered that it
was impossible for any of us to make our escape.…
At last, when the ship we were in, had got in all her cargo, they made ready with
many fearful noises, and we were all put under deck, so that we could not see how
they managed the vessel. But this disappointment was the least of my sorrow. The
stench of the hold while we were on the coast was so intolerably loathsome, that it
was dangerous to remain there for any time, and some of us had been permitted to
stay on the deck for the fresh air; but now that the whole ship’s cargo were confined
together, it became absolutely pestilential. The closeness of the place, and the heat
of the climate, added to the number in the ship, which was so crowded that each
had scarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us. This produced copious
perspirations, so that the air soon became unfit for respiration, from a variety of
loathsome smells, and brought on a sickness among the slaves, of which many died
—thus falling victims to the improvident avarice, as I may call it, of their
purchasers. This wretched situation was again aggravated by the galling of the
chains, now became insupportable, and the filth of the necessary tubs, into which
the children often fell, and were almost suffocated. The shrieks of the women, and
the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a scene of horror almost inconceivable.
Happily perhaps, for myself, I was soon reduced so low here that it was thought
necessary to keep me almost always on deck; and from my extreme youth I was not
put in fetters. In this situation I expected every hour to share the fate of my
companions, some of whom were almost daily brought upon deck at the point of
death, which I began to hope would soon put an end to my miseries. Often did I
think many of the inhabitants of the deep much more happy than myself. I envied
them the freedom they enjoyed, and as often wished I could change my condition
for theirs. Every circumstance I met with, served only to render my state more
painful, and heightened my apprehensions, and my opinion of the cruelty of the
whites.
One day they had taken a number of fishes; and when they had killed and
satisfied themselves with as many as they thought fit, to our astonishment who were
on deck, rather than give any of them to us to eat, as we expected, they tossed the
remaining fish into the sea again, although we begged and prayed for some as well
as we could, but in vain; and some of my countrymen, being pressed by hunger, took
an opportunity, when they thought no one saw them, of trying to get a little
privately; but they were discovered, and the attempt procured them some very
severe floggings.
One day, when we had a smooth sea and moderate wind, two of my wearied
countrymen who were chained together (I was near them at the time), preferring
death to such a life of misery, somehow made through the nettings and jumped into
the sea; immediately, another quite dejected fellow, who, on account of his illness,
was suffered to be out of irons, also followed their example; and I believe many

more would very soon have done the same, if they had not been prevented by the
ship’s crew, who were instantly alarmed.…
At last we came in sight of the island of Barbados, at which the whites on board
gave a great shout, and made many signs of joy to us. We did not know what to
think of this; but as the vessel drew nearer, we plainly saw the harbor, and other
ships of different kinds of sizes, and we soon anchored amongst them, off
Bridgetown. Many merchants and planters now came on board, though it was in the
evening. They put us in separate parcels, and examined us attentively. They also
made us jump, and pointed to the land, signifying we were to go there. We thought
by this, we should be eaten by these ugly men, as they appeared to us; and, when
soon after we were all put down under the deck again, there was much dread and
trembling among us, and nothing but bitter cries to be heard all the night from these
apprehensions, insomuch, that at last the white people got some old slaves from the
land to pacify us. They told us we were not to be eaten, but to work, and were soon
to go on land, where we should see many of our country people. This report eased us
much. And sure enough, soon after we were landed, there came to us Africans of all
languages.
We were conducted immediately to the merchant’s yard, where we were all pent
up together, like so many sheep in a fold, without regard to sex or age. As every
object was new to me, everything I saw filled me with surprise. What struck me first,
was, that the houses were built with bricks and stories, and in every other respect
different from those I had seen in Africa; but I was still more astonished on seeing
people on horseback. I did not know what this could mean; and, indeed, I thought
these people were full of nothing but magical arts. While I was in this astonishment,
one of my fellow prisoners spoke to a countryman of his, about the horses, who said
they were the same kind they had in their country. I understood them, though they
were from a distant part of Africa; and I thought it odd I had not seen any horses
there; but afterwards, when I came to converse with different Africans, I found they
had many horses amongst them, and much larger than those I then saw.
We were not many days in the merchant’s custody, before we were sold after their
usual manner, which is this: On a signal given (as the beat of a drum), the buyers
rush at once into the yard where the slaves are confined, and make choice of that
parcel they like best. The noise and clamor with which this is attended, and the
eagerness visible in the countenances of the buyers, serve not a little to increase the
apprehension of terrified Africans, who may well be supposed to consider them as
the ministers of that destruction to which they think themselves devoted. In this
manner, without scruple, are relations and friends separated, most of them never to
see each other again.
I remember, in the vessel in which I was brought over, in the men’s apartment,
there were several brothers, who, in the sale, were sold in different lots; and it was
very moving on this occasion, to see and hear their cries at parting. O, ye nominal
Christians! might not an African ask you—Learned you this from your God, who
says unto you, Do unto all men as you would men should do unto you? Is it not
enough that we are torn from our country and friends, to toil for your luxury and
lust of gain? Must every tender feeling be likewise sacrificed to your avarice? Are the
dearest friends and relations, now rendered more dear by their separation from their
kindred, still to be parted from each other, and thus prevented from cheering the
gloom of slavery, with the small comfort of being together, and mingling their
sufferings and sorrows? Why are parents to lose their children, brothers their sisters,
or husbands their wives? Surely, this is a new refinement in cruelty, which, while it

has no advantage to atone for it, thus aggravates distress, and adds fresh horrors
even to the wretchedness of slavery.

CHAPTER 18
THE SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION AND GLOBAL IMPACT
During the seventeenth century, major scientific discoveries occurred in Western
Europe, along with increasingly precise statements of the general scientific method.
Western science built on earlier contacts, particularly with Arab science, but now it
pressed further. Some discoveries provided Europeans with an understanding
scientists in other societies had assumed for some time—for example, that the earth
is not the center of the universe. Others provided brand new knowledge. Along with
the specific findings came an excitement about science, a belief (among some) that
science should serve as the centerpiece for all knowledge—and these features had
never before developed in any culture, despite important scientific traditions dating
back many centuries.
The scientific revolution, and the disputes it roused, particularly with religious
authorities, quickly had major impact within Europe. Religion declined, though it
hardly disappeared. Scientific approaches began to be applied to social topics, as
well as topics in the physical universe. New relationships between science and
technological innovation began to develop. Much of this extension occurred during
the eighteenth century, in the Enlightenment.
Ultimately, Western science would spread widely, and indeed many societies
would begin to contribute to modern scientific work. During the early modern
period, however, reactions were somewhat more mixed and tentative. The Ottoman
Empire, for example, with a proud scientific tradition of its own, hesitated to import
much Western science. Japan, fairly isolated culturally during the seventeenth
century, began to allow translations of Western scientific work after about 1720; the
Japanese encountered this work through their trading contacts with the Dutch.
China, again with an important scientific tradition of its own, maintained some
contact with Western discoveries but would not begin to incorporate them
thoroughly until the late nineteenth century. Russia (see chapter 19) by the
eighteenth century tried actively to import new kinds of scientific training.
The documents that follow highlight some of the key features of the scientific
revolution itself. They also allow consideration of several different reactions, where
comparison becomes essential. They help explain why the new science, though
Western in origin, would ultimately spur global changes in intellectual life and in
education.
Questions
1. How did the new science relate to established religion in Western Europe? How
did scientists seek to deal with religious objections?
2. What kind of broader intellectual attitudes did the scientific revolution
encourage?
3. What was new about the Enlightenment idea of progress?
4. What advantages did Japanese intellectuals begin to see in Western science? How
did this science seem to relate to their own traditions?
5. Why did many Ottoman officials hesitate to embrace Western science?
6. What was the early modern Chinese interaction with Western science? Why did it

not immediately lead to broader incorporation of modern science?
7. Why did some societies open up to Western science earlier than others?
For Further Discussion
1. How did Western science affect interregional cultural contacts? How would it
affect Western attitudes toward other parts of the world?
2. Why might Russia or Japan take an earlier interest in Western science than China
or the Ottoman empire?
3. To what extent has modern science led to religious decline in world history during
the past three centuries?
GALILEO
Galileo, an Italian scientist of the early seventeenth century, made major discoveries
about gravity and about planetary motion. He also suggested some of the
intellectual style that could accompany the new science. His clashes with the Church
ultimately landed him in prison, though in fairly luxurious conditions. The following
letter was written in 1617.
•••
GALILEO’S LETTER TO THE GRAND DUCHESS OF TUSCANY

To the Most Serene Grand Duchess Mother:
Some years ago, as Your Serene Highness well knows, I discovered in the
heavens many things that had not been seen before our own age. The novelty
of these things, as well as some consequences which followed from them in
contradiction to the physical notions commonly held among academic
philosophers, stirred up against me no small number of professors—as if I
had placed these things in the sky with my own hands in order to upset
nature and overturn the sciences. They seemed to forget that the increase of
known truths stimulates the investigation, establishment, and growth of the
arts; not their diminution or destruction.
From Modern History Sourcebook, http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/galileotuscany.html.
Showing a greater fondness for their own opinions than for truth they
sought to deny and disprove the new things which, if they had cared to look
for themselves, their own senses would have demonstrated to them. To this
end they hurled various charges and published numerous writings filled with
vain arguments, and they made the grave mistake of sprinkling these with
passages taken from places in the Bible which they had failed to understand
properly, and which were ill-suited to their purposes.
These men would perhaps not have fallen into such error had they but
paid attention to a most useful doctrine of St. Augustine’s, relative to our
making positive statements about things which are obscure and hard to
understand by means of reason alone. Speaking of a certain physical
conclusion about the heavenly bodies, he wrote: “Now keeping always our
respect for moderation in grave piety, we ought not to believe anything
inadvisedly on a dubious point, lest in favor to our error we conceive a
prejudice against something that truth hereafter may reveal to be not
contrary in any way to the sacred books of either the Old or the New

Testament.”
Well, the passage of time has revealed to everyone the truths that I
previously set forth; and, together with the truth of the facts, there has come
to light the great difference in attitude between those who simply and
dispassionately refused to admit the discoveries to be true, and those who
combined with their incredulity some reckless passion of their own. Men
who were well grounded in astronomical and physical science were
persuaded as soon as they received my first message. There were others who
denied them or remained in doubt only because of their novel and
unexpected character, and because they had not yet had the opportunity to
see for themselves. These men have by degrees come to be satisfied. But
some, besides allegiance to their original error, possess I know not what
fanciful interest in remaining hostile not so much toward the things in
question as toward their discoverer. No longer being able to deny them,
these men now take refuge in obstinate silence, but being more than ever
exasperated by that which has pacified and quieted other men, they divert
their thoughts to other fancies and seek new ways to damage me.
I should pay no more attention to them than to those who previously
contradicted me–at whom I always laugh, being assured of the eventual
outcome—were it not that in their new calumnies and persecutions I
perceive that they do not stop at proving themselves more learned than I am
(a claim which I scarcely contest), but go so far as to cast against me the
imputations of crimes which must be, and are, more abhorrent to me than
death itself. I cannot remain satisfied merely to know that the injustice of
this is recognized by those who are acquainted with these men and with me,
as perhaps it is not known to others.
Persisting in their original resolve to destroy me and everything mine by
any means they can think of, these men are aware of my views in astronomy
and philosophy. They know that as to the arrangement of the parts of the
universe, I hold the sun to be situated motionless in the center of the
revolution of the celestial orbs while the earth revolves about the sun. They
know also that I support this position not only by refuting the arguments of
Ptolemy and Aristotle, but by producing many counter-arguments; in
particular, some which relate to physical effects whose causes can perhaps
be assigned in no other way. In addition there are astronomical arguments
derived from many things in my new celestial discoveries that plainly
confute the Ptolemaic system [the system that held the earth to be center of
the universe] while admirably agreeing with and confirming the contrary
hypothesis. Possibly because they are disturbed by the known truth of other
propositions of mine which differ from those commonly held, and therefore
mistrusting their defense so long as they confine themselves to the field of
philosophy, these men have resolved to fabricate a shield for their fallacies
out of the mantle of pretended religion and the authority of the Bible. These
they apply with little judgment to the refutation of arguments that they do
not understand and have not even listened to.…
CONDORCET AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT IDEA OF PROGRESS
Condorcet was a French aristocrat and an eager participant in the Enlightenment.
His Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind (1793)

extended the implications of the new science. Ironically, Condorcet was arrested
during the radical phase of the French Revolution and committed suicide rather than
wait for execution.
•••
No one has ever believed that the human mind could exhaust all the facts of nature,
all the refinements of measuring and analyzing these facts, the interrelationship of
objects, and all the possible combinations of ideas.…
But because, as the number of facts known increases, man learns to classify them,
to reduce them to more general terms; because the instruments and the methods of
observation and exact measurement are at the same time reaching a new precision;
… the truths whose discovery has cost the most effort, which at first could be
grasped only by men capable of profound thought, are soon carried further and
proved by methods that are no longer beyond the reach of ordinary intelligence. If
the methods that lead to new combinations are exhausted, if their application to
problems not yet solved requires labors that exceed the time or the capacity of
scholars, soon more general methods, simpler means, come to open a new avenue
for genius.…
•••
Applying these general reflections to the different sciences, we shall give, for each,
examples of their successive improvement that will leave no doubt as to the
certainty of the future improvements we can expect. We shall indicate particularly
the most likely and most imminent progress in those sciences that are now
commonly believed to be almost exhausted. We shall point out how more universal
education in each country, by giving more people the elementary knowledge that
can inspire them with a taste for more advanced study and give them the capacity
for making progress in it, can add to such hopes; how [these hopes] increase even
more, if a more general prosperity permits a greater number of individuals to pursue
studies, since at present, in the most enlightened countries, hardly a fiftieth part of
those men to whom nature has given talent receive the education necessary to make
use of their talents; and that, therefore, the number of men destined to push back the
frontiers of the sciences by their discoveries will grow in the same proportion [as
universal education increases].
We shall show how this equality of education, and the equality that will arise
between nations, will speed up the advances of those sciences whose progress
depends on observations repeated in greater number over a larger area; all that
mineralogy, botany, zoology, meteorology can be expected to gain thereby; and
finally what an enormous disproportion exists, in these sciences, between the
weakness of the means that nevertheless have led us to so many useful and
important truths, and the great scope of the means men will in the future be able to
deploy.
•••
If we now turn to the mechanical arts, we shall see that their progress can have no
other limit than the reach of the scientific theories on which they depend; that the
methods of these arts are capable of the same improvement, the same
simplifications as methods in the sciences. Instruments, machines, looms will
increasingly supplement the strength and skill of men; will augment at the same
time the perfection and the precision of manufactures by lessening both the time
and the labor needed to produce them. Then the obstacles that still impede this

progress will disappear, and along with them accidents that will become preventable
and unhealthy conditions in general, whether owing to work, or habits, or climate.
Then a smaller and smaller area of land will be able to produce commodities of
greater use or higher value; wider enjoyment will be obtained with less outlay; the
same manufacturing output will call for less expenditure of raw materials or will be
more durable. For each kind of soil people will know how to choose, from among
crops that satisfy the same kind of need, those crops that are most versatile, those
that satisfy [the needs of a greater mass of users, requiring less labor and less real
consumption. Thus, without any sacrifice, the methods of conservation and of
economy in consumption will follow the progress of the art of producing the various
commodities, preparing them and turning them into manufactures.
Thus not only will the same amount of land be able to feed more people; but each
of them, with less labor, will be employed more productively and will be able to
satisfy his needs better.
•••
But in this progress of industry and prosperity… each generation … is destined to
fuller enjoyment; and hence, as a consequence of the physical constitution of the
human species, to an increase of the population. Will there not come a time when…
the increase in population surpassing its means of subsistence, the result would
necessarily be—if not a continuous decline in wellbeing and number of people, a
truly retrograde movement—at least a kind of oscillation between good and bad?
Would not such oscillations in societies that have reached this point be an everpresent cause of more or less periodic suffering? Would this not mark the limit
beyond which all improvement would become impossible…?
No one will fail to see how far removed from us this time is; but will we reach it
one day. It is impossible to speak for or against an event that will occur only at a
time when the human species will necessarily have acquired knowledge that we
cannot even imagine. And who, in fact, would dare to predict what the art of
converting the elements to our use may one day become?
But supposing a limit were reached, nothing terrible would happen, regarding
either the happiness or the indefinite perfectibility of mankind. We must also
suppose that before that time, the progress of reason will have gone hand in hand
with progress in the arts and sciences; that the ridiculous prejudices of superstition
will no longer cover morality with an austerity that corrupts and degrades it instead
of purifying and elevating it. Men will know then that if they have obligations to
beings who do not yet exist, these obligations do not consist in giving life, but in
giving happiness. Their object is the general welfare of the human species, of the
society in which people live, of the family to which they belong and not the puerile
idea of filling the earth with useless and unhappy beings. The possible quantity of
the means of subsistence could therefore have a limit, and consequently so could the
attainable level of population, without resulting in the destruction … of part of the
living.
Among the progress of the human mind that is most important for human
happiness, we must count the entire destruction of the prejudices that have
established inequality between the sexes, fatal even to the sex it favors. One would
look in vain for reasons to justify it, by differences in physical constitution,
intelligence, moral sensibility. This inequality has no other source but the abuse of
power, and men have tried in vain to excuse it by sophisms.

We shall show how much the destruction of customs authorized by this prejudice,
of the laws it has dictated, can contribute to the greater happiness of families, and
to the spread of the domestic virtues, the first foundation of all other virtues. It will
promote the progress of education, because [education] will be extended to both
sexes more equally, and because education cannot become general, even among
men, without the cooperation of mothers.
•••
All these causes of the improvement of the human species, all these means that
assure it, will by their nature act continuously and acquire a constantly growing
momentum. We have explained the proofs of this…; we could therefore already
conclude that the perfectibility of man is unlimited, even though, up to now, we
have only supposed him endowed with the same natural faculties and organization.
What then would be the certainty and extent of our hopes if we could believe that
these natural faculties themselves and this organization are also susceptible of
improvement? This is the last question remaining for us to examine.
The organic perfectibility or degeneration of races in plants and animals may be
regarded as one of the general laws of nature.
This law extends to the human species; and certainly no one will doubt that
progress in medical conservation [of life], in the use of healthier food and housing, a
way of living that would develop strength through exercise without impairing it by
excess, and finally the destruction of the two most active causes of degradation—
misery and too great wealth—will prolong the extent of life and assure people more
constant health as well as a more robust constitution. We feel that the progress of
preventive medicine as a preservative, made more effective by the progress of reason
and social order, will eventually banish communicable or contagious illnesses and
those diseases in general that originate in climate, food, and the nature of work. It
would not be difficult to prove that this hope should extend to almost all other
diseases, whose more remote causes will eventually be recognized. Would it be
absurd now to suppose that the improvement of the human race should be regarded
as capable of unlimited progress? That a time will come when death would result
only from extraordinary accidents or the more and more gradual wearing out of
vitality, and that, finally, the duration of the average interval between birth and
wearing out has itself no specific limit whatsoever? No doubt man will not become
immortal, but cannot the span constantly increase between the moment he begins to
live and the time when naturally, without illness or accident, he finds life a burden?
FATHER DE HALDE AND SCIENCE IN CHINA
Father de Halde was a Catholic missionary who discussed science at the court of the
Qing emperor, in the late seventeenth century. His comments date from around
1680. Catholic missionaries had long sought to interest Chinese officials in science
and in specific technologies like Western clocks, as a means of winning opportunities
for direct missionary work. Is this account an accurate representation of Chinese
reactions?
•••
This nation, naturally proud, looked upon themselves as the most learned in the
world, and they enjoyed this reputation without disturbance because they were
acquainted with no other people more knowing than themselves; but they were
undeceived by the ingenuity of the missionaries who appeared at court. The proof

which they gave of their capacity served greatly to authorize their ministry and to
gain esteem for the religion which they preached. The late emperor, Kang xi, whose
chief delight was to acquire knowledge, was never weary of seeing or hearing them.
On the other hand, the Jesuits, perceiving how necessary the protection of this great
prince was to the progress of the Gospel, omitted nothing that might excite his
curiosity and satisfy this natural relish for the sciences.
From Eva March Tappan, ed., The World’s Story. Vol. 1, China, Japan, and the
Islands of the Pacific (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1914), 155–62.
They gave him an insight into optics by making him a present of a semi-cylinder
of a light kind of wood. In the middle of its axis was placed a convex glass, which,
being turned toward any object, painted the image within the tube to a great nicety.
The emperor was greatly pleased with so unusual a sight, and desired to have a
machine made in his garden at Peking, wherein, without being seen himself, he
might see everything that passed in the streets and neighboring places. They
prepared for this purpose an object-glass of much greater diameter, and made in the
thickest garden wall a great window in the shape of a pyramid, the basis of which
was towards the garden, and the point toward the street. At the point they fixed the
glass eye over against the place where there was the greatest concourse of people; at
the basis was made a large closet, shut up close to all sides and very dark. It was
there the emperor came with his queens to observe the lively images of everything
that passed in the street; and this sight pleased him extremely; but it charmed the
princesses a great deal more, who could not otherwise behold this spectacle, the
custom of China not allowing them to go out of the palace. [Another missionary]
gave another wonderful spectacle by his skill in optics in the Jesuits’ Garden at
Peking, which greatly astonished the grandees of the emperor. They made upon four
walls four human figures, every one being of the same length as the wall, which was
fifty feet. As he had perfectly observed the optic rules, there was nothing seen on the
front but mountains, forests, chases, and other things of this nature; but at a certain
point they perceived the figure of a man well made and well-proportioned. The
emperor honored the Jesuits’ house with his presence, and beheld these figures a
long time with admiration. The grandees and principal mandarins, who came in
crowds, were equally surprised; but that which struck them most was to see the
figures so regular and so exact upon irregular walls that in several places had large
windows and doors. In catoptrics they presented the emperor with all sorts of
telescopes, as well for astronomical observations as for taking great and small
distances upon the earth; and likewise glasses for diminishing, magnifying, and
multiplying. Among other things, they presented him with a tube made like a prism
having eight sides, which being placed parallel with the horizon, presented eight
different scenes so lifelike that they might be mistaken for the objects themselves;
this being joined to the variety of painting entertained the emperor a long time.
They likewise presented another tube wherein was a polygon glass, which by its
different facets collected into one image several parts of different objects, insomuch
that instead of a landscape, woods, flocks, and a hundred other things represented in
a picture, there was seen distinctly a human face or some other figure very exact.
There was also another machine which contained a lighted lamp, the light of which
came through a tube, at the end whereof was a convex glass, near which several
small pieces of glass painted with divers figures were made to slide. These figures
were seen upon the opposite wall of a size proportioned to the size of the wall. This
spectacle in the nighttime or in a very dark place frightened those who were
ignorant of the artifice as much as it pleased those who were acquainted with it.

[The missionaries also] offered the emperor a machine the principal parts of which
were only four notched wheels and an iron grapple. With the help of this machine, a
child raised several thousand weight without difficulty, and stood firm against the
efforts of twenty strong men. With respect to hydrostatics, they made for the
emperor pumps, canals, siphons, wheels, and several other machines proper to raise
water out of the river, called the ten thousand springs, and to carry it into the
ground belonging to the emperor’s demesnes, as he had desired. [They] also made a
present to the emperor of a hydraulic machine of a new type. There appeared in it a
clock that went very true, the motions of the heavens, and an accurate alarm. The
pneumatic machines also did no less excite the emperor’s curiosity. They caused a
wagon to be made of light wood about two feet long. In the middle of it they placed
a brazen vessel full of live coals, and upon that an aeolipile, the wind of which came
through a little pipe upon a sort of wheel made like the sails of a windmill. This
little wheel turned another with an axle-tree, and by that means set the wagon in
motion for two hours together; but lest room should be wanting to proceed
constantly forward, it was contrived to move circularly in the following manner: To
the axle-tree of the two hind wheels was fixed a small beam, and at the end of this
beam another axle-tree, which went through the center of another wheel somewhat
larger than the rest.
They did not fail afterwards to comply with the emperor’s taste for great
quantities of curious things were sent out of Europe by Christian princes, who had
the conversion of this great empire at heart, insomuch that the emperor’s cabinet
was soon filled with various rarities, especially clocks of the most recently invented
and most curious workmanship.
They also presented the emperor with thermometers to show the several degrees
of heat and cold, to which was added a very nice hygrometer to discover the several
degrees of moisture and dryness. It was a barrel of a large diameter, suspended by a
thick string made of catgut of a proper length and parallel to the horizon. The least
change in the air contracts or relaxes the string, and causes the barrel to turn
sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left, and stretches or loosens to the right or
left upon the circumference of the barrel a small string which draws a little
pendulum and marks the several degrees of humidity on one, and on the other those
of dryness.
All these different inventions of human wit, till then unknown to the Chinese,
abated something of their natural pride and taught them not to have too
contemptible an opinion of foreigners; nay, it so far altered their way of thinking
that they began to look upon Europeans as their masters.
SCIENCE IN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE: LADY MONTAGUE
Lady Montague was wife of the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, who
wrote in the early eighteenth century (her husband began his service in 1717). She
here describes a system of inoculation against smallpox, which she used on her own
children. This system was extended by Edward Jenner in Europe later in the
eighteenth century, through use of a serum cultivated in cattle.
•••
A propos of distempers, I am going to tell you a thing that will make you wish
yourself here. The small-pox, so fatal, and so general amongst us, is here entirely
harmless, by the invention of engrafting, which is the term they give it. There is a set
of old women, who make it their business to perform the operation, every autumn,

in the month of September, when the great heat is abated. People send to one
another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the small-pox; they make
parties for this purpose, and when they are met (commonly fifteen or sixteen
together) the old woman comes with a nut-shell full of the matter of the best sort of
small-pox, and asks what vein you please to have opened. She immediately rips open
that you offer to her, with a large needle (which give you no more pain that a
common scratch) and puts into the vein as much matter as can lie upon the head of
her needle, and after that, binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell, and
in this matter opens up four or five veins. The Grecians have commonly the
superstition of opening one in the middle of the forehead, one in each arm, and one
on the breast, to mark the sign of the cross; but this has a very ill effect, all these
wounds leaving little scars, and is not done by those that are not superstitious, who
cause to have them in the legs, or that part of the arm that is concealed. The
children or young patients play together all the rest of the day, and are in perfect
health to the eighth. Then the fever begins to seize them, and they keep their beds
two days, very seldom three. They have very rarely above twenty or thirty in their
faces, which never mark, and in eight days time they are as well as before their
illness. Where they were wounded, there remains running sores during the distemper,
which I don’t doubt is a great relief to it. Every year, thousands undergo this
operation, and the French Ambassador says pleasantly, that they take the smallpox
here by way of diversion, as they take the waters in other countries. There is no
example of any one that had dies of it, and you may believe I am well satisfied of
the safety of this experiment, since I intend to try it on my dear little son. I am
patriot enough to take the pains to bring this useful invention into fashion in
England, and I should not fail to write to some of our doctors very particularly
about it, if I knew any one of them that I thought had virtue enough to destroy such
a considerable branch of their revenue, for the good of mankind. But that distemper
is too beneficial to them, not to expose to all their resentment, the hardy weight that
should undertake to put an end to it. Perhaps if I live to return, I may, however,
have courage to war with them. Upon this occasion, admire the heroism in the heart
of your friend.
REACTION IN JAPAN: SUGITA GENPAKU
Sugita Genpaku, 1733–1817, was a member of the so-called Dutch school, because
of his involvement in translations from Dutch scientific works.

The corpse of the criminal was that of an old woman of about 50 years, nicknamed
Aocha Bab, born in Kyoto. I was an old butcher who made the dissection. We had
been promised an eda named Toramatsu, known for his skill in dissection, but
because he was sick his grandfather came instead. He was ninety years old, but
healthy, and he told us he had been doing this since his youth. According to him up
until this time people had left it up to him, and he had not shown them where the
lungs, kidneys, and other organs were. They would pretend that they had studied the
internal structure of the body directly. But the parts naturally weren’t labeled, and
they had to be satisfied with the way he pointed them out. He knew where
everything was, but he had not learned their proper names. … Some ofthe things
turned out to be arteries, veins, and suprarenal bodies according to our [Dutch]

anatomical tables. … We found that the structure of the lungs and liver and the
position and shape of the stomach were quite different from what we had believed
according to old Chinese theory. … I suggested that we decipher the Tafel
Anatomica (the book they were using) without the aid of the interpreters in
Nagasaki, and translate it into Japanese. … the next day we met and began. …
Gradually we got so we could decipher ten lines or more a day. After two or three
years of hard study everything became clear to us; the joy of it was as the chewing
of sweet sugar cane.

CHAPTER 19
THE GUNPOWDER EMPIRES
One of the great developments of the early modern period was the emergence of
new land-based empires in various parts of Asia and Eastern Europe. These are
sometimes called gunpowder empires because their conquests depended in part on
the use of cannon. They arose at the same time that Western Europeans were
constructing overseas empires, also using superior force. Interestingly, Western
Europeans were often considerably awed by the Asian empires, whose administrative
personnel, armies, and cities far surpassed those available in the national
monarchies back home.
The documents that follow deal with three new empires—the Ottoman, Mughal,
and Russian. They also all involve relationships with the West. Two documents come
from Western observers, noting the strengths though also some of the constraints of
the great empires. A cluster of documents from Russia (which was not so highly
esteemed by Western observers) deal with efforts to use Western contacts to effect
internal reforms around 1700. Russia’s westernization, though highly selective, was
in marked contrast to the lack of interest of many Asian leaders in Western example.
The empires discussed here were dazzling at the time, during most of the early
modern period, clearly demonstrating superior military and political capacity. Two
of them, however, would ultimately decline: the Mughal began to loosen its grip by
the eighteenth century, the Ottoman by the nineteenth. And in both cases increasing
European intrusion would result. It is vital to remember the achievements that
preceded decline and that could have continuing impact in the regions. The same
applies to Russia, which would encounter new challenges as a multinational empire
at the end of the twentieth century though it managed to maintain vast holdings.
Questions
1. Why were European observers awed by the Ottoman and Mughal Empires? Were
the reasons similar or different in the two cases?
2. Why might European observers exaggerate strengths in the empires?
3. Do the comments suggest why the Mughal Empire declined much sooner than the
Ottoman?
4. In what ways was Russia more interested in active contacts with the West than the
Ottoman or Mughal Empires? Why was this the case?
5. What did Peter the Great seek to westernize, and what did he leave untouched?
For Further Discussion
1. What were some significant contributions of the Ottoman and Mughal Empires to
their regions, the Middle East and India, respectively?
2. Why did the Russian Empire last longer than the other two empires?
3. What were some characteristic weaknesses in the gunpowder empires?
THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE: BUSBECQ
Ogier Chiselin be Busbecq, of Flemish origin (in what is now Belgium), was an
ambassador from the Holy Roman Empire to the Ottoman sultan, in Constantinople,

from 1555 to 1562. His letters provide important data on the Ottomans. He was,
however, eager to see reform in the Holy Roman Empire, and actively shaped his
observations of the Ottoman Empire to encourage change back home.
•••
At Buda I made my first acquaintance with the Janissaries; this is the name by which
the Turks call the infantry of the royal guard. The Turkish state has 12,000 of these
troops when the corps is at its full strength. They are scattered through every part of
the empire, either to garrison the forts against the enemy, or to protect the
Christians and Jews from the violence of the mob. There is no district with any
considerable amount of population, no borough or city, which has not a detachment
of Janissaries to protect the Christians, Jews, and other helpless people from outrage
and wrong.
The Turkish monarch going to war takes with him over 400 camels and nearly as
many baggage mules, of which a great part are loaded with rice and other kinds of
grain. These mules and camels also serve to carry tents and armour, and likewise
tools and munitions for the campaign. … The invading army carefully abstains from
encroaching on its [supplies] at the outset; as they are well aware that when the
season for campaigning draws to a close, they will have to retreat over districts
wasted by the enemy, or scraped bare by countless hordes of men and droves of
hungry animals, as if they had been devastated by locusts; accordingly they reserve
their stores as much as possible for this emergency.
From C. T. Forster and F. H. Daniel, eds., The Life and Letters of Ogier Chiselin de
Busbecq, vol. 1 (London: Kegan Paul, 1881) 86–88, 219–22.
From this you will see that it is the patience, self-denial and thrift of the Turkish
soldier that enable him to face the most trying circumstances and come safely out of
the dangers that surround him. What a contrast to our men! Christian soldiers on a
campaign refuse to put up with their ordinary food, and call for thrushes, beccaficos
[a small bird esteemed a dainty, as it feeds on figs and grapes], and suchlike dainty
dishes! … It makes me shudder to think of what the result of a struggle between
such different systems must be; one of us must prevail and the other be destroyed, at
any rate we cannot both exist in safety. On their side is the vast wealth of their
empire, unimpaired resources, experience and practice in arms, a veteran solidery,
and uninterrupted series of victories, readiness to endure hardships, union, order,
discipline, thrift and watchfulness. On ours are found an empty exchequer, luxurious
habits, exhausted resources, broken spirits, a raw and insubordinate soldiery, and
greedy quarrels; there is no regard for discipline, license runs riot, the men indulge
in drunkenness and debauchery, and worst of all, the enemy are accustomed to
victory, we to defeat. Can we doubt what the result must be? The only obstacle is
Persia, whose position on his rear forces the invader to take precautions. The fear of
Persia gives us a respite, but it is only for a time.
No distinction is attached to birth among the Turks; the deference to be paid to a
man is measured by the position he holds in the public service. There is no fighting
for precedence; a man’s place is marked out by the duties he discharges. In making
his appointments the Sultan pays no regard to any pretensions on the score of
wealth or rank, nor does he take into consideration recommendations or popularity,
he considers each case on its own merits, and examines carefully into the character,
ability, and disposition of the man whose promotion is in question. It is by merit
that men rise in the service, a system which ensures that posts should only be
assigned to the competent. Each man in Turkey carries in his own hand his ancestry

and his position in life, which he may make or mar as he will. Those who receive the
highest offices from the Sultan are for the most part the sons of shepherds or
herdsmen, and so far from being ashamed of their parentage, they actually glory in
it, and consider it a matter of boasting that they owe nothing to the accident of
birth; for they do not believe that high qualities are either natural or hereditary, nor
do they think that they can be handed down from father to son, but that they are
partly the gift of God, and partly the result of good training, great industry, and
unwearied zeal; arguing that high qualities do not descend from a father to his son
or heir, any more than a talent for music, mathematics, or the like; and that the
mind does not derive its origin from the father, so that the son should necessarily be
like the father in character, or emanates from heaven, and thence infused into the
human body. Among the Turks, therefore, honours, high posts, and judgeships are
the rewards of great ability and good service. If a man be dishonest, or lazy, or
careless, he remains at the bottom of the ladder, an object of contempt; for such
qualities there are no honours in Turkey.
This is the reason that they are successful in their undertakings, that they lord it
over others, and are daily extending the bounds of their empire. These are not our
ideas, with us there is no opening left for merit; birth is the standard for everything;
the prestige of birth is the sole key to advancement in the public service.
THE MUGHAL EMPIRE: MONSERATE AND BERNIER
Antonio Monserate was a Jesuit who visited the great Emperor Akbar’s court from
1580 to 1583, at the benefit of the Mughal power. The following are excerpts from
his Commentary. François Bernier, a Frenchman, was the personal physician of the
Mughal emperor Aurangzeb for twelve years. He wrote the first European work
dealing with racial classifications of humans, and in 1684 he published his Travels
to the Mughal Empire to detail his experiences in India.
•••
MONSERATE

This Prince is of a stature and type of countenance well fitted to his royal dignity, so
that one could easily recognize even at first glace that he is the king.… His forehead
is broad and open, his eyes so bright and flashing that they seem like a sea
shimmering in the sunlight.… He creates an opportunity almost every day for any of
the common people or of the nobles to see him and converse with him. It is
remarkable how great an effect this courtesy and affability has in attaching to him
the minds of his subjects … he has an acute insight, and shows much wise foresight
both in avoiding dangers and in seizing favorable opportunities for carrying out his
designs.… Unlike the palaces built by other Indian kings, his are lofty [and] their
total circuit is so large that it easily embraces four great royal dwellings.… Not a
little is added to the beauty of the palaces by charming pigeon cotes.… The pigeons
are cared for by eunuch and servant maids. Their evolutions are controlled at will,
when they are flying, by means of certain signals, just as those of a well trained
soldiery.… It will seem little short of miraculous when I affirm that when sent out
they dance, turn somersaults all together in the air, flying orderly rhythm, and
return to their starting point, all at the sound of a whistle. [Akbar’s] empire is
wonderfully rich and fertile both for cultivation and pasture, and has a great trade
both in exports and imports.… Indian towns appear very pleasant from afar; they
are adorned with many towers and high buildings in a very beautiful manner. But

when one enters them, one finds that the narrowness, aimless crookedness and ill
planning of the streets deprive these cities of all beauty.… The common people live
in lowly huts and tiny cottages, and hence if a traveler has seen one of these cities,
he has seen them all.
EUROPEAN AWE AT OTHER EMPIRES
BERNIER

The Moguls have left and communicated their name to the strangers that now
govern Indostan, the country of the Indians; though those that are employed in
public charges and offices, and even those that are listed in the militia, be not all of
the race of the Moguls, but strangers and nations gathered out of all countries, most
of them Persians, some Arabians, and some Turks. For, to be esteemed a mogul it is
enough to be a stranger, white of face, and a Muslim; in distinction as well to the
Indians, who are brown and pagans, as to the Christians of Europe, who are called
Franguis [i.e., “Ferengis” or “Franks”].…
My lord, you may have seen before this, by the maps of Asia, how great every
way is the extent of the empire of the Great Mogul, which is commonly called India
or Indostan. I have not measured it mathematically; but to speak of it accordingly to
the ordinary journeys of the country, after the rate of three whole months’ march,
traversing from the frontiers of the kingdom of Golconda as far as beyond Kazni
near Kandahar, which is the first town of Persia, I cannot but persuade myself
otherwise but that it is at least five times as far as from Paris to Lyons—that is about
five hundred common leagues.…
In this same extent of country there are sundry nations which the Mogul is not
full master of, most of them still retaining their particular sovereigns and lord that
neither obey him nor pay him tribute but from constraint; many that do little, some
that do nothing at all, and some also that receive tribute from him.…
… Of the like sort are more than an hundred rajahs, or considerable heathen
sovereigns, dispersed through the whole empire, some near to, others remote from,
Agra and Delhi; amongst whom there are about fifteen or sixteen that are very rich
and puissant [several of them princes]; are so great and powerful that if they three
alone should combine they would hold him [i.e. the Great Moghul] back; each of
them being able in a very short time to raise and bring into the field twenty-five
thousand horse, better troops than the Mogul’s. These cavaliers are called rajipous,
or children of the rajahs. These are men who, as I have said elsewhere, carry swords
from father to son, and to whom the rajahs allot land on condition that they be
always ready to appear on horseback when the rajah commands. They can endure
much hardship, and they want nothing but good order and discipline to make them
good soldiers.…
The Mogul is obliged to keep these rajas in his service for sundry reasons: the first,
because the militia of the rajahs is a very good (as we said above) and because there
are rajash (as was intimated also) any one of whom can bring into the field above
twenty-five thousand men; the second, the better to bridle the other rajahs and to
reduce them to reason, when they cantonize, or when they refuse to pay tribute, or
when, out of fear or other cause, they will not leave their country to serve in the
army when the Mogul requires it; the third, the better to nourish jealousies and
keenness among them, by favoring and caressing one more than the other, which is
done to that degree that they proceed to fight with one another very frequently.

From James Harvey Robinson, ed., Readings in European History, vol. 2 (Boston:
Ginn, 1906), 336–38.
THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE: PETER THE GREAT (1682–1725)
The first of the following decrees from the czar involved the creation of a Governing
Senate (council), which reflected some of the changes he sought in administration
and state functions. A second decree, from 1714, established so-called compulsory
education for the nobles (though this was not actually fully enforceable); a related
“instruction” urged selective study abroad. A 1721 decree (number 4) was designed
to encourage manufacturing, but through a very distinctive means. Finally, a 1724
decree set up an academy modeled on Western associations—such as the Royal
Society in England, which had been established in the seventeenth century—to
encourage discussion of science. Which reforms probably had the greatest impact?
Which would be most likely to encounter resistance? What groups and activities
were left untouched?
•••
The ukaz [decree] should be made known. We have decreed that during our absence
administration of the country is to be [in the hands of] the Governing Senate [Peter
then names its new members].…
Each gubernia [region] is to send two officials to advise the Senate on judicial
and legislative matters.…
In our absence the Senate is charged by this ukaz with the following:
1. To establish a just court, to deprive unjust judges of their offices and of all their
property, and to administer the same treatment to all slanderers.
2. To supervise governmental expenditures throughout the country and cancel
unnecessary and, above all, useless things.
3. To collect as much money as possible because money is the artery of war.
4. To recruit young noblemen for officer training, especially those who try to evade
it; also to select about 1,000 educated boyars for the same purpose.
5. To reform letters of exchange and keep these in one place.
6. To take inventory of goods leased to offices or gubernias.
7. To farm out the salt trade in an effort to receive some profit [for the state].
8. To organize a good company and assign to it the China trade.
9. To increase trade with Persia and by all possible means to attract in great
numbers Armenians [to that trade]. To organize inspectors and inform them of
their responsibilities.
2. Education Decree

Send to every gubernia [region] some persons from mathematical schools to teach
the children of the nobility—except those of freeholders and government clerks—
mathematics and geometry; as a penalty [for evasion] establish a rule that no one
will be allowed to marry unless he learns these [subjects]. Inform all prelates to
issue no marriage certificates to those who are ordered to go to schools.…
The Great Sovereign has decreed: in all gubernias children between the ages of ten
and fifteen of the nobility, of government clerks, and of lesser officials, except those
of freeholders, must be taught mathematics and some geometry. Toward that end,

students should be sent from mathematical schools [as teachers], several into each
gubernia, to prelates and to renowned monasteries to establish schools. During their
instruction these teachers should be given food and financial remuneration of three
altyns and two dengas per day from gubernia revenues set aside for that purpose by
personal orders of His Imperial Majesty. No fees should be collected from students.
When they have mastered the material, they should then be given certificates written
in their own handwriting. When the students are released they ought to pay one
ruble each for their training. Without these certificates they should not be allowed to
marry nor receive marriage certificates.
3. Navigation Study Abroad

1. Learn [how to draw] plans and charts and how to use the compass and other
naval indicators.
2. [Learn] how to navigate a vessel in battle as well as in a simple maneuver, and
learn how to use all appropriate tools and instruments; namely sails, ropes, and
oars, and the like matters, on row boats and other vessels.
3. Discover as much as possible how to put ships to sea during a naval battle. Those
who cannot succeed in this effort must diligently ascertain what action should
taken by the vessels that do and those that do not put to sea during such a
situation [naval battle]. Obtain from [foreign] naval officers written statements,
bearing their signatures and seals, of how adequately you [Russian students] are
prepared for [naval] duties.
4. If, upon his return, anyone wishes to receive [from the Tsar] greater favors for
himself, he should learn, in addition to the above enumerated instructions, how to
construct those vessels aboard which he would like to demonstrate his skills.
5. Upon his return to Moscow, every [foreign-trained Russian] should bring with him
at his own expense, for which he will later be reimbursed, at least two experienced
masters of naval science. They [the returnees] will be assigned soldiers, one soldier
per returnee, to teach them [what they have learned abroad]. And if they do not
wish to accept soldiers they may teach their acquaintances or their own people.
The treasure will pay for transportation and maintenance of soldiers. And if
anyone other than soldiers learns [the art of navigation] the treasurer will pay 100
rubles for the maintenance of every such individual.…
4. Right of Factories to Buy Villages

Previous decrees have denied merchants the right to obtain villages. This prohibition
was instituted because those people, outside their business, did not have any
establishments that could be of any use to the state. Nowadays, thanks to Our
decrees, as every one can see, many merchants have companies and many have
succeeded in establishing new enterprises for the benefit of the state; namely: silver,
copper, iron, coal and the like, as well as silk, linen, and woolen industries, many of
which have begun operations. As a result, by this Our ukaz aimed at the increase of
factories, We permit the nobility as well as merchants to freely purchase villages for
these factories, with the sanction of the Mining and Manufacturing College, under
one condition: that these villages be always integral parts of these factories.
Consequently, neither the nobility nor merchants may sell or mortgage these villages
without the factories because of pressing needs, it must be done with the permission
of the Mining and Manufacturing College. And whoever violates this procedure will
have his possessions confiscated.
And should someone try to establish a small factory for the sake of appearance in

order to purchase a village, such an entrepreneur should not be allowed to purchase
anything. The Mining and Manufacturing College should adhere to this rule very
strictly. Should such a thing happen, those responsible for it should be deprived of
all their movable and immovable property.
5. Founding the Academy

His Imperial Majesty decreed the establishment of an academy, wherein languages as
well as other science and important arts could be taught, and where books could be
translated. On January 22, [1724], during his stay in the Winter Palace, His Majesty
approved the project for the Academy, and with his own hand signed a decree that
stipulates that the Academy’s budget of 24,912 rubles annually should come from
revenues from custom dues and export-import license fees collected in the following
cities: Narva, Dorpat, Pernov and Arensburg.…
Usually two kinds of institutions are used in organizing arts and sciences. One is
known as a university; the other as an Academy or society of arts and sciences.
1. A University is an association of learned individuals who teach the young people
the development of such distinguished science as theology and jurisprudence (the
legal skill), and medicine and philosophy. An Academy, on the other hand, is an
association of learned and skilled people who not only know their subjects to the
same degree [as their counterparts in the University] but who, in addition,
improve and develop them through research and inventions. They have no
obligation to teach others.
2. While the Academy consists of the same scientific disciplines and has the same
members as the University, these two institutions, in other states, have no
connection between themselves in training many other well-qualified people who
could organize different societies. This is done to prevent interference into the
activity of the Academy, whose sole task is to improve arts and science through
theoretical research that would benefit professors as well as students of
universities. Freed from the pressure of research, universities can concentrate on
educating the young people.
3. Now that an institution aimed at the cultivation of arts and sciences is to be
chartered in Russia, there is no need to follow the practice that is accepted in
other states. It is essential to take into account the existing circumstances of this
state [Russia], consider [the quality of Russian] teachers and students, and
organize such an institution that would not only immediately increase the glory of
this [Russian] state through the development of sciences, but would also, through
teaching and dissemination [of knowledge], benefit the people [of Russia] in the
future.
4. These two aims will not be realized if the Academy of Sciences alone is chartered,
because while the Academy may try to promote and disseminate arts and sciences,
these will not spread among the people. The establishment of a university will do
even less, simply because there are no elementary schools, gymnasia or seminaries
[in Russia], where young people could learn the fundamentals before studying
more advanced subjects [at the University] to make themselves useful. It is
therefore inconceivable that under these circumstances a university would be of
some value [to Russia].
5. Consequently what is needed most [in Russia] is the establishment of an
institution that would consist of the most learned people, who, in turn, would be
willing: (a) to promote and perfect the sciences while at the same time, wherever

possible, be willing (b) to give public instruction to young people (if they feel the
latter are qualified) and (c) instruct some people individually so that they in turn
could train young people [of Russia] in the fundamental principles of all sciences.

CHAPTER 20
COFFEE IN EARLY MODERN WORLD HISTORY
One of the key features of the early modern period involved the circulation of new
goods among different regions, and the related development of new consumer tastes.
Tobacco, cotton, and silver, and their literally global exchange, began to play
serious roles in shaping world history—through consumption, production, and trade,
and the regional relationships involved.
Coffee was a major player as well. Native to northeastern Africa, it spread
initially through the Middle East during the sixteenth century. Europeans
encountered it there, and coffee enjoyed growing popularity from the seventeenth
century onward. In both regions, and later more widely still, coffee affected not only
personal consumption but also, potentially, health and sleep and, above all, new
patterns of sociability and exchange of news and views.
Coffee was also controversial—like many novel products, but with some
particularly interesting disputes and debates. The following documents, from the
Middle East and Europe, suggest key issues in coffee’s progress. They must be
compared, so that we can get at the nature of clashing viewpoints. They must be
subtly analyzed, so that we can look between the lines of the critiques to assess
coffee’s impact. And of course they invite consideration of the relationship between
Middle Eastern and European patterns.
Questions
1. What were some of the main objections to coffee?
2. Why did coffee gain steadily in popularity?
3. Were there significant differences between coffee’s early history in the Middle East
and that in Western Europe? What might account for major differences and
similarities?
4. What were some of the political and social implications of coffee? Were there also
gender implications?
5. What types of people opposed coffee, and why? What types of people favored it?
For Further Discussion
1. Is a humble product like coffee a significant subject for world history?
2. To what extent did attacks on coffee fail, and why?
3. Did the spread of coffee relate to other significant developments in early modern
Middle Eastern or European history?
4. Does the history of coffee suggest analogies to reactions to other kinds of new
products, either in the past or today?
A MIDDLE EASTERN ACCOUNT
This selection comes from an Arab manuscript written in the seventeenth or early
eighteenth century.
Schehabeddin Ben, an Arabian author of the ninth century of the Gegira, or fifteenth
of the Christians, attributes to Gemaleddin, Mufti of Aden [the Arabian Gulf], who

was nearly his contemporary, the first introduction into that country, of drinking
Coffee. He tells us, that Gemaleddin, having occasion to travel into Persia, during his
abode there, saw some of his countrymen drinking Coffee, which at that time he did
not much attend to; but, on his return to Aden, finding himself indisposed, and
remembering that he had seen his countrymen drinking Coffee in Persia, in hopes of
reviving some benefit from it, he determined to try it on himself; and, after making
the experiment, not only recovered his health, but perceived other useful qualities in
that liquor; such as relieving the headache, enlivening the spirits, and, without
prejudice to the constitution, preventing drowsiness. This last quality he resolved to
turn to the advantage of his profession: he took it himself, and recommended it to
the Dervishes, or religious Muslims, to enable them to pass the night in prayer, and
other exercises of their religions, with greater zeal and attention. Soon men of
letters, and persons belonging to the law, adopted the use of it. These were followed
by the tradesmen, and artisans that were under a necessity of working in the night,
and such as were obliged to travel later after sunset. At length the custom become
general in Aden; and it was not only drunk in the night by those who were desirous
of being kept awake, but in the day for the sake of its other agreeable qualities.
Coffee, being thus received at Aden, where it has continued in use ever since
without interruption, passed by degrees to many neighboring towns; and not long
after reached Mecca, where it was introduced, as at Aden, by the Dervishes, and for
the same purposes of religion. The inhabitants of Mecca, were at last so fond of this
liquor, that, without regarding the intention of the religious, and other studious
persons, they at length drank it publicly in coffeehouses, where they assembled in
crowds to pass the time agreeably, making that the pretense: here they played at
chess, and such other kind of games, and that even for money. In these houses they
amused themselves likewise with singing, dancing, and music, contrary to the
manners of the rigid Muslims, which afterwards was the occasion of some
disturbances.
From John Ellis, A Historical Account of Coffee with an Engraving, and Botanical
Description of the Tree (London: Edward and Charles Dilly, 1774).
From hence the custom extended itself to many other towns of Arabia, and
particularly to Medina, and then to Grand Cairo in Egypt.
But at length the rigid Muslims began to disapprove the use of Coffee, as
occasioning frequent disorders, and too nearly resembling wine in its effects; the
drinking of which is contrary to the tenets of their religion. Government was
therefore obliged to interfere, and at times refrain from the use of it. However, it
had become so universally liked, that it was found afterwards necessary to take off
all restraint for the future.
[By 1554 coffee reached Constantinople, and two Syrian merchants] sold Coffee
publicly, in rooms fitted up in an elegant manner; which were presently frequented
by men of learning, and particularly poets and other persons, who came to amuse
themselves with a game of chess, or draughts; or to make acquaintance, and pass
their time agreeably at small expense.
These houses and assemblies insensibly became so much in vogue, that they were
frequented by people of all professions, and even by the officers of the ferablio, the
pachas, and persons of the first rank about the court. However, when they seemed to
be the most firmly established, the Imans, or officers of the Mosques, complained
loudly of their being deserted, while the Coffeehouses were full of company.…
The chief of the Law … pronounced that the drinking of Coffee was contrary to

the law of Mohammed. Immediately all the Coffeehouses were shut, and the officers
of the police were commanded to prevent any one from drinking coffee. However,
the habit was become so strong, and the use of it so generally agreeable, that the
people continued, notwithstanding all prohibitions, to drink it in their own houses.
The officers of the police, seeing they could not suppress the use of it, allowed… the
drinking of it, provided it was not done openly; so that it was drunk in particular
places, with the doors shut, or in the back room of some of the shopkeepers’ houses.

slothfulnesse, and the other properties that
we have mentioned, let him use much

bring in danger of the leprosy.

THE CHARACTER OF A COFFEE-HOUSE, 1673 A.D.

A coffee-house is a lay conventicler, good-fellowship turned puritan, ill-husbandry in
masquerade, whither people come, after toping all day, to purchase, at the expense
of their last penny, the repute of sober companions: A Rota [i.e. club room], that,
like Noah’s ark, receives animals of every sort, from the precise diminutive band, to
the hectoring cravat and cuffs in folio; a nursery for training up the smaller fry of
virtuosi in confident tattling, or a cabal of knitting [i.e. carping] critics that have
only learned to spit and mew; a mint of intelligence, that, to make each man his
pennyworth, draws out into petty parcels, what the merchant receives in bullion: he,
that comes often, saves twopence a week in Gazettes, and has his news and his
coffee for the same charge, as at a threepenny ordinary they give in broth to your
chop of mutton; it is an exchange, where haberdashers of political small-wares meet,
and mutually abuse each other, and the public, with bottomless stories, and heedless
notions; the rendezvous of idle pamphlets, and persons more idly employed to read
them; a high court of justice, where every little fellow in a camlet cloak takes upon

him to transpose affairs both in church and state, to show reasons against acts of
parliament, and condemn the decrees of general councils.
From Charles W. Colby, ed., Selections from the Sources of English History, B.C.

S. Arkenberg.
COFFEE-HOUSES VINDICATED, 1675 A.D.

Though the happy Arabia, nature’s spicery, prodigally furnishes the voluptuous
world with all kinds of aromatics, and divers other rarities; yet I scare know whether
mankind be not still as much obliged to it for the excellent fruit of the humble
coffee-shrub, as for any other of its more specious productions: for, since there is
nothing we here enjoy, next to life, valuable beyond health, certainly those things
that contribute to preserve us in good plight and eucrasy (such a due mixture of
qualities as constitutes health), and fortify our weak bodies against the continual
assaults and batteries of disease, deserve our regards much more than those which
only gratify a liquorish palate, or otherwise prove subservient to our delights. As for
this salutiferous berry, of so general a use through all the regions of the east, it is
sufficiently known, when prepared, to be moderately hot, and of a very drying
attenuating and cleansing quality; whence reason infers, that its decoction must
contain many good physical properties, and cannot but be an incomparable remedy
to dissolve crudities, comfort the brain, and dry up ill humors in the stomach. In
brief, to prevent or redress, in those that frequently drink it, all cold drowsy
rheumatic distempers whatsoever, that proceed from excess of moisture, which are
so numerous, that but to name them would tire the tongue of a mountebank.
Lastly, for diversion. Now, whither shall a person, wearied with hard study, or the
laborious turmoils of a tedious day, repair to refresh himself? Or where can young
gentlemen, or shop-keepers, more innocently and advantageously spend an hour or
two in the evening, than at a coffee-house? Where they shall be sure to meet
company, and, by the custom of the house, not such as at other places, stingy and
reserved to themselves, but free and communicative; where every man may modestly
begin his story, and propose to, or answer another, as he thinks fit.
In brief, it is undeniable, that, as you have here the most civil, so it is, generally,
the most intelligent society; the frequenting whose converse, and observing their
discourses and deportment, cannot but civilize our manners, enlarge our
understanding, refine our language, teach us a generous confidence and handsome
mode of address, and brush off the pudor rubrusticus (as, I remember, Tully
somewhere calls it), that clownish kind of modesty frequently incident to the best
natures, which render them sheepish and ridiculous in company.

PART IV

The Long Nineteenth Century
BEGINNING ABOUT 1750, changes in Europe’s economy and politics began to create the

conditions for another reshaping of the framework of world history. Some elements
of this reshaping—the rise of industry and new kinds of powered equipment, for
example, or new ideals of democracy—still persist today. But the changes initially
generated a surge of European power in the world that has not endured in full force.
In this sense a world history period that begins with European revolutions in the
eighteenth century and ends in 1914, on the eve of Europe’s relative decline in world
affairs, constitutes an obviously coherent unit. Many historians call this period the
long nineteenth century. With the long nineteenth century, in other words, the
world’s industrial era began, and it is still unfolding. At the same time, a shorter but
significant period of European dominance prevailed during the period as well, based
on temporary monopoly of industrial power.
During the late eighteenth century the industrial revolution developed in Britain.
It featured the rise of factory industry and the use of the new powered machinery,
with the invention of a usable steam engine being the central technological
innovation. Industrialization fairly quickly spread to other parts of Western Europe
and to the United States. It allowed a massive increase in the production of goods,
including new kinds of weaponry, plus more rapid systems of transportation and
communication. During the same period, a series of Western revolutions and wars of
independence were also launched, stretching from the United States to Western
Europe and back to Latin America.
These changes helped set in motion a massive increase in the power of the West in
the world at large. Technology and military power were crucial. Western armies
could now defeat much larger landed forces; the naval advantage was enhanced as
well. Western victories or successful intimidations in Ottoman territory (1798), in
China (1839–42), in Japan (1853), and in Russia (1854–55) demonstrated the new
international balance of power. Massive imperialist conquests in Africa, Southeast
Asia, and the Pacific brought direct European control to new areas. Even Latin
America, though now technically independent, found itself more fully dominated by
Western commercial interests than ever before.
Massive changes in the West itself, accompanying the rise of an industrial society
and the gradual emergence of political democracy, were matched, in world history,
by the need to react both to Western power and to Western values. These reactions
varied, which means that comparative issues in world history remain complicated.
Japan quickly saw the need to reform (though not to become Western), while China
lagged. India’s changes, as a colony, obviously differed from those of the Ottoman
Empire, which remained technically independent though increasingly beleaguered.
Africa, seized late in the imperialist surge and then exploited vigorously, displayed
distinctive patterns of its own. Important new areas of the world, including the
United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, formed societies in many ways
Western in orientation but tempered by frontier conditions and an unusual mixture
of races. Attention to careful comparisons is vital in order to get reactions to early
industrialization and to Western imperialism amid very diverse settings.
This section deals with several key issues of world history in the long nineteenth
century in a number of comparative groupings. The new political ideas and
revolutions that rocked the Atlantic regions from the late eighteenth century to 1848

launched the period. Comparing revolutionary ideas and some unexpected
consequences, including the powerful modern force of nationalism, involves Europe
and the Americas alike.
Growing European power and decidedly undemocratic attitudes toward other
peoples spawned the new wave of imperialism. Europeans’ forced entry into China,
from 1839 onward, represented the imperialist thrust while marking a tremendous—
and very difficult—transition in Chinese history. The Chinese were forcefully opened
to the world and at a great disadvantage. There is a clear opportunity here to
compare European imperialist ideas with the reactions of a proud but weakened
civilization.
New political ideas accompanied by complex economic changes produced
important shifts in the conditions of women, leading to new ideas and new
complaints. Changes in the West, accompanying imperialism, also caused shifts in
colonial areas such as India, although westernization was incomplete where women
were concerned.
The end of widespread slavery (save in a few important pockets) and harsh
serfdom was one of the great events of nineteenth-century world history, extending
from emancipations accompanying the revolutionary era up to the final decades of
the century. Emancipations occurred in response to some of the same economic and
cultural forces the world over, but the precise forms and consequences varied. Many
dissatisfactions remained, as labor was incompletely freed despite great legal change
and as existing upper classes and dominant races worked to retain key advantages.
Again, comparison helps pinpoint the crucial issues.
While industrialization was largely a Western achievement during the long
nineteenth century, by the 1890s, both Japan and Russia had managed to launch
significant factory industry, imitating Western patterns in part but supplying special
ingredients from their own cultural and institutional frameworks. Differences
between Japanese and Western economic styles, still operative today, can be traced
to the long nineteenth century, even though Japan openly copied the West in many
respects. Russia and Japan also generated notable resistance to Western values, using
nationalism to defend certain traditions and “inventing” others that would help
preserve distinctive identities amid change. Here was an important reminder that,
even in a century of triumphant Western power, the world remained diverse and
many societies sought the means to limit Western influence.

CHAPTER 21
THE AGE OF ATLANTIC REVOLUTIONS
This chapter and the next (on nationalism) are closely linked. Both involve major
political changes that took shape first in Europe and the Americas in the later
eighteenth century but exerted global impact over ensuing decades. This chapter
focuses on the revolutionary principles themselves (and objections to them). The
subsequent section on nationalism allows comparison of the relationship between
the core revolutionary values and the political force that emerged alongside them.
The American Revolution, bursting forth in 1776, and the French Revolution of
1789 both enunciated universal principles of human rights. They deserve careful
comparison: similarities are obvious, but are there any suggestive differences? Two
other documents add to the comparative mix: a critique of the French Revolution,
which needs to be compared to what the revolutionaries thought they were
establishing ; and another French revolutionary document that suggests the social
force of this revolution, beyond political change.
In the wake of these revolutions, a major revolt broke out in Haiti, which
ultimately overthrew French control and abolished slavery. How do the principles of
this revolution, and objections to it, compare with the other Atlantic cases?
Questions
1. What were the shared principles of the Atlantic revolutions? What explains their
similarities? What were the underlying definitions of human nature and the
characteristics of a good government?
2. What differences existed in the statements of rights and liberties?
3. How does the Haitian Revolution reflect the revolutionary process more
generally? What were some of its distinctive features?
4. How did the social aspects of the French and Haitian Revolutions relate to the
political goals? Were they entirely consistent, or could they raise some
complications with statements of rights and liberties?
5. What kinds of objections were raised to the revolutionary principles? Did the
critics reject the revolutionary principles themselves or merely the disruption and
violence of the revolutionary process? How did Burke begin to define a new kind
of conservatism?
For Further Discussion
1. Some historians have argued that the American Revolution is best interpreted as
an independence war, not a real revolution at all, if the French revolution is used
as the standard. What was “unrevolutionary” about the American revolution?
2. Why did the revolutionary principles, which spread so quickly in Europe and the
Americas, not spread more widely, to other parts of the globe, during the same
period?
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION
This document emanated from the First Continental Congress (October 1774). The
Revolutionary War had not broken out, and there was still some effort to reach

accommodation with England. But the principles that would lead to revolt and to
the construction of the later United States Constitution were clearly enunciated.
•••
DECLARATION AND RESOLVES OF THE FIRST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS (OCTOBER 1774)

Whereas, since the close of the last war, the British parliament, claiming a power of
right to bind the people of America by statute in all cases whatsoever, hath, in some
acts expressly imposed taxes on them, and in others, under various pretenses, but in
fact for the purpose of raising a revenue, hath imposed rates and duties payable in
these colonies, established a board of commissioners with unconstitutional powers,
and extended the jurisdiction of courts of Admiralty not only for collecting the said
duties, but for the trial of causes merely arising within the body of a county.
And whereas, in consequence of other statutes, judges who before held only
estates at will in their offices, have been made dependent on the Crown alone for
their salaries, and standing armies kept in times of peace. And it has lately been
resolved in Parliament, that by force of a statute made in the thirty-fifth year of the
reign of king Henry the Eighth, colonists may be transported in England, and tried
there upon accusations for treasons and misprisons, or concealments of treasons
committed in the colonies; and by a late statute, such trials have been directed in
cases therein mentioned.
And whereas, in the last session of Parliament, three statutes were made; one
entitled “An act to discontinue, in such manner and for such time as are therein
mentioned, the landing and discharging, lading, or shipping of goods, wares and
merchandise, at the town, and within the harbor of Boston in the province of
Massachusetts-bay, in North America”; another, entitled “An act for the better
regulating the government of the province of the Massachusetts-bay in New
England”; and another, entitled “An act for the impartial administration of justice, in
the cases of persons questioned for any act done by them in the execution of the
law, or for the suppression of riots and tumults, in the province of the
Massachusetts-bay, in New England.” And another statute was then made, “for
making more effectual provision for the government of the province of Quebec, etc.
All which statues are impolitic, unjust, and cruel, as well as unconstitutional, and
most dangerous and destructive of American rights.
And whereas, Assemblies have been frequently dissolved, contrary to the rights of
the people, when they attempted to deliberate on grievances; and their dutiful,
humble, loyal, and reasonable petitions to the crown for redress, have been
repeatedly treated with contempt, by His Majesty’s ministers of state:
The good people of the several Colonies of New Hampshire, Massachusetts bay,
Rhode Island and Providence plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Newcastle Kent and Sussex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North
Carolina, and South Carolina, justly alarmed at these arbitrary proceedings of
parliament and administration, have severally elected, constituted, and appointed
deputies to meet, and set in general Congress, in the city of Philadelphia, in order to
obtain such establishment, as that their religion, laws, and liberties, may not be
subverted:
Whereupon the deputies so appointed being now assembled, in a full and free
representation of these Colonies, taking into their most serious consideration the
best means of attaining the ends aforesaid, do in the first place, as Englishmen their
ancestors in like cases have usually done, for asserting and vindicating their rights

and liberties, declare,
That the inhabitants of the English Colonies in North America, by the immutable
laws of nature, the principles of the English constitution, and the several charters or
compacts, have the following rights:
1. That they are entitled to life, liberty, and property, and they never ceded to any
sovereign power whatever, a right to dispose of either without their consent.
2. That our ancestors, who first settled these colonies, were at the time of their
emigration from the mother country, entitled to all the rights, liberties, and
immunities of free and natural born subjects within the realm of England.
3. That by such emigration they by no means forfeited, surrendered, or lost any of
those rights, but that they were, and their descendants now are entitled to the
exercise and enjoyment of all such of them, as their local and other circumstances
enable them to exercise and enjoy.
4. That the foundation of English liberty, and of all free government, is a right in the
people to participate in their legislative council: and as the English colonists are
not represented, and from their local and other circumstances, cannot properly be
represented in the British parliament, they are entitled to a free and exclusive
power of legislation in their several provincial legislatures, where their right of
representation can alone be preserved, in all cases of taxation and internal polity,
subject only to the negative of their sovereign, in such manner as has been
heretofore used and accustomed. But, from the necessity of the case, and a regard
to the mutal interest of both countries, we cheerfully consent to the operation of
such acts of the British parliament, as are bona fide restrained to the regulation of
our external commerce, for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of
the whole empire to the mother country, and the commercial benefits of its
respective members excluding every idea of taxation, internal or external, for
raising a revenue on the subjects in America without their consent.
5. That the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England, and more
especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the
vincinage, according to the course of that law.…
6. That they have a right peaceably to assemble, consider of their grievances, and
petition the King; and that all prosecutions, prohibitory proclamations, and
commitments for the same, are illegal.
7. That the keeping a Standing army in these colonies, in times of peace, without the
consent of the legislature of that colony in which such army is kept, is against law.
8. It is indispensably necessary to good government, and rendered essential by the
English constitution, that the constituent branches of the legislature be
independent of each other; that, therefore, the exercise of legislative power in
several colonies, by a council appointed during pleasure, by the crown, is
unconstitutional, dangerous, and destructive to the freedom of American
legislation.
All and each of which the aforesaid deputies, in behalf of themselves, and their
constituents, do claim, demand, and insist on, as their indubitable rights and
liberties; which cannot be legally taken from them, altered or abridged by any
power whatever, without their own consent, by their representatives in their several
provincial legislatures.

THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
The Declaration of the Rights of Man was one of the early proclamations of the new
National Assembly, the body that succeeded the traditional Third Estate. It was
called on August 26, 1789.
•••
DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN

The representatives of the French people, organized as a National Assembly,
believing that the ignorance, neglect, or contempt of the rights of man are the sole
cause of public calamities and of the corruption of governments, have determined to
set forth in a solemn declaration the natural, unalienable, and sacred rights of man,
in order that this declaration, being constantly before all the members of the Social
body, shall remind them continually of their rights and duties; in order that the acts
of the legislative power, as well as those of the executive power, may be compared
at any moment with the objects and purposes of all political institutions and may
thus be more respected, and, lastly, in order that the grievances of the citizens, based
hereafter upon simple and incontestable principles, shall tend to the maintenance of
the constitution and redound to the happiness of all. Therefore the National
Assembly recognizes and proclaims, in the presence and under the auspices of the
Supreme Being, the following rights of man and of the citizen: Articles:
From Cybercasting Services Division of the National Public Telecomputing Network.
http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/rightsof.htm.
1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be
founded only upon the general good.
2. The aim of all political associations is the preservation of the natural and
imperceptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and
resistance to oppression.
3. The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. No body nor
individual may exercise any authority which does not proceed directly from the
nation.
4. Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence
the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which
assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights.
These limits can only be determined by law.
5. Law can only prohibit such actions as are hurtful to society. Nothing may be
prevented which is not forbidden by law, and no one may be forced to do
anything not provided for by law.
6. Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right to participate
personally, or through his representative, in its foundation. It must be the same
for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in the eyes of the
law, are equally eligible to all dignities and to all public positions and
occupations, according to their abilities, and without distinction except that of
their virtues and talents.
7. No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the cases and
according to the forms prescribed by law. Any one soliciting, transmitting,
executing, or causing to be executed, any arbitrary order, shall be punished. But
any citizen summoned or arrested in virtue of the law shall submit without

delay, as resistance constitutes an offense.
8. The law shall provide for such punishments only as are strictly and obviously
necessary, and no one shall suffer punishment except it be legally inflicted in
virtue of a law passed and promulgated before the commission of the offense.
9. As all persons are held innocent until they shall have been declared guilty, if
arrest shall be deemed indispensable, all harshness not essential to the securing
of the prisoner’s person shall be severely repressed by law.
10. No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious
views, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established
by law.
11. The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the
rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with
freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be
defined by law.
12. The security of the rights of man and of the citizen requires public military
forces. These forces are, therefore, established for the good of all and not for the
personal advantage of those to whom they shall be entrusted.
13. A common contribution is essential for the maintenance of the public forces and
for the cost of administration. This should be equitably distributed among all the
citizens in proportion to their means.
14. All the citizens have a right to decide, either personally or by their
representatives, as to the necessity of the public contribution; to grant this freely;
to know to what uses it is put; and to fix the proportion, the mode of assessment
and of collection and the duration of the taxes.
15. Society has the right to require of every public agent an account of his
administration.
16. A society in which the observance of the law is not assured, nor the separation
of powers defined, has no constitution at all.
17. Since property is an inviolable and sacred right, no one shall be deprived thereof
except where public necessity, legally determined, shall clearly demand it, and
then only on condition that the owner shall have been previously and equitably
indemnified.
DECREE ABOLISHING FEUDALISM
This decree, adopted officially on August 11, 1789, followed from reports of
widespread peasant attacks on landed estates and manorial records. The goal was to
pacify the peasantry, but the results involved sweeping social change.
•••
The Decree Abolishing the Feudal System, August 11, 1789

Article I. The National Assembly hereby completely abolishes the feudal system. It
decrees that, among the existing rights and dues, [including] feudal [dues], all those
originating in or representing real or personal serfdom shall be abolished without
indemnification. All other dues are declared redeemable, the terms and mode of
redemption to be fixed by the National Assembly. Those of the said dues which are
not extinguished by this decree shall continue to be collected until indemnification
shall take place.

From J. H. Robinson ed., Readings in European History, vol. 2 (Boston: Ginn, 1906),
404–9.
III. The exclusive right to hunt and to maintain unenclosed warrens is likewise
abolished, and every landowner shall have the right to kill, or to have destroyed on
his own land, all kinds of game, observing, however, such police regulations as may
be established with a view to the safety of the public.…
IV. All perpetual ground rents, payable either in money or in kind, of whatever
nature they may be, whatever their origin and to whomsoever they may be due, …
shall be redeemable at a rate fixed by the Assembly. No due shall in the future be
created which is not redeemable.
VI. The sale of judicial and municipal offices shall be abolished forthwith. Justice
shall be dispensed gratis. Nevertheless the magistrates at present holding such offices
shall continue to exercise their functions and to receive their emoluments until the
Assembly shall have made provision for indemnifying them.…
IX. Pecuniary privileges, personal or real, in the payment of taxes are abolished
forever. Taxes shall be collected from all the citizens, and from all property, in the
same manner and in the same form. Plans shall be considered by which the taxes
shall be paid proportionally by all, even for the last six months of the current years.
…
XI. All citizens, without distinction of birth, are eligible to any office or dignity,
whether ecclesiastical, civil, or military; and no profession shall imply any
derogation.
EDMUND BURKE
Edmund Burke became a pioneering spokesman for antirevolutionary conservatism,
as he increasingly attacked the French Revolution from his position in the British
House of Commons. His Reflections on the Revolution in France was published in
1790.
•••
Abstractly speaking, government, as well as liberty, is good; yet could I, in common
sense, ten years ago, have congratulated France on her enjoyment of a government
(for she then had a government) without enquiry what the nature of that
government was, or how it was administered? Can I now congratulate the same
nation upon its freedom? Is it because liberty in the abstract may be classed
amongst the blessings of mankind, that I am seriously to felicitate a madman, who
has escaped from the protecting restraint and wholesome darkness of his cell, on his
restoration to the enjoyment of light and liberty? Am I to congratulate a
highwayman and murderer, who has broke prison, upon the recovery of his natural
rights?
From Edmund Burke, Select Works of Edmund Burke, vol. 2 (London: Payne, 1876),
93–94.
When I see the spirit of liberty in action, I see a strong principle at work; and this,
for a while, is all I can possibly know of it. The wild gas, the fixed air, is plainly
broke loose: but we ought to suspend our judgment until the first effervescence is a
little subsided, til the liquor is cleared, and until we see something deeper than the
agitation of a troubled and frothy surface. I must be tolerably sure, before I venture
publicly to congratulate men upon a blessing, that they have really received one.

Flattery corrupts both the receiver and the giver; and adulation is not of more
service to the people than to kings. I should therefore suspend my congratulations
on the new liberty of France, until I was informed how it had been combined with
government; with public force; with the discipline and obedience of armies; with the
collection of an effective and well-distributed revenue; with morality and religion;
with the solidity of property; with peace and order; with civil and social manners.
All these (in their way) are good things too; and without them, liberty is not a
benefit whilst it lasts, and is not likely to continue long. The effect of liberty to
individuals is, that they may do what they please: we ought to see what it will please
them to do, before we risk congratulations, which may be soon turned into
complaints. Prudence would dictate this in the case of separate insulated private
men; but liberty, when men act in bodies, is power. Considerate people, before they
declare themselves, will observe the use which is made of power; and particularly of
so trying a thing as new power in new persons, of whose principles, tempers, and
dispositions, they have little or no experience.…
THE HAITIAN REVOLUTION
The following proclamation, issued by several Haitian leaders, including JeanJacques Dessalines, was issued in 1803. It refers among other things to the
possibility of interference by France; Napoleon bitterly opposed the revolution,
which led to Haitian independence from France, though he was unable to act
effectively.
•••
Preliminary Declaration
Art. 1. The people inhabiting the island formerly called St. Domingo, hereby agree to
form themselves into a free state sovereign and independent of any other power in
the universe, under the name of empire of Hayti.
2. Slavery is forever abolished.
From Marcus Rainsford, An Historical Account of the Black Empire of Hayti
(London, 1805), 439–41.
3. The Citizens of Hayti are brothers at home; equality in the eyes of the law is
incontestably acknowledged, and there cannot exist any titles, advantages, or
privileges, other than those necessarily resulting from the consideration and reward
of services rendered to liberty and independence.
4. The law is the same to all, whether it punishes, or whether it protects.
5. The law has no retroactive effect.
6. Property is sacred, its violation shall be severely prosecuted. [But later: all
property which formerly belonged to white Frenchemen, is incontestably and of
right confiscated to the use of the state.]
9. No person is worthy of being a Haitian who is not a good father, a good son, a
good husband, and especially a good soldier.
12. No white man of whatever nation he may be, shall put his foot on this
territory with the title of master or proprietor, neither shall he in future acquire any
property therein.
13. The preceding article cannot in the smallest degree affect white women who
have been naturalized Haytians by Government, nor does it extend to children

already born, or that may be born of the said women.

FROM A FRENCH NEWSPAPER
This article appeared in the Courier francais on August 23, 1796, as the Haitian
revolution began. It was based on a letter sent by a French plantation owner.
•••
Since my first letter, which accompanies this, there has occurred, and there is still
occurring, what follows:
At Port-au-Prince, and in the environs, the Negroes are in a state of insurrection;
they have burnt many habitations, which had remained untouched til this day. The
Negroes will not work.
From Pennsylvania Gazette, Sept. 28, 1796.
On this side of Grand Rivière, there is a great rising; the Brigand Negroes have
killed a Negro chief named Gagnet, who commanded for the [French] Republic, his
family, and the état-major. Fifteen thousand men taken from the principal posts are
to go against the revolters; they doubt much the success of these new Republicans. I
deplore the unhappy fate of the inhabitants of St. Domingo. It is impossible for them
to come with security to their habitations. The Negroes who have returned to their
habitations will not absolutely attend to speak to their masters; they are willing
enough to be Republicans, but point de travail [no work]; they think it is contrary to
Republican rights; by this title they are to be supplied with all that is necessary.
The mask is thrown off—the Negroes say, haughtily, that St. Domingo belongs to
them; on this condition they will work, otherwise not.

CHAPTER 22
NATIONALISM
Nationalism is one of the great forces of modern history, so much so that it is
sometimes hard to step back and realize what a new kind of loyalty it is. Despite
some hints of nationalist-type beliefs earlier, most people in 1750 identified
themselves in terms of locality and, often, religion, not nation. From 1750 onward,
however, first in Europe and then more globally, intellectual advocacy of
nationalism, growing social changes—such as urbanization—that weakened
traditional ties, and increasing interregional contacts all promoted nationalism.
Nationalism sprang in part from the revolutionary era of the late eighteenth
century. The idea of citizen links with government helped nationalism in France, for
example, where the world’s first national anthem originated. Later, however,
nationalism could be used as a conservative force, defending against social protests
and often using adventures abroad to distract from tensions back home.
Rising nationalism played a role in many revolutions, from the American and
French Revolutions onward. It supported major changes like the Latin American
wars of independence and the Italian and the German unifications. It provided one
of the major bases for opposition to European imperialism. It contributed to
numerous wars.
Nationalism embodied a number of analytical tensions, beyond the liberalconservative divide. How would nationalists react to nations other than their own?
How would a nationalist balance national goals with other goals such as liberal
institutions or economic advance—in other words, where would nationalism fit in a
priority list? How would a nationalist balance appeals to national traditions, real or
imagined, with a desire to promote more modern development?
The documents that follow offer insights into several aspects of nationalism,
including its somewhat elusive basic definition. A proclamation by the French
Revolution’s National Convention helps explain how the revolution could promote
nationalism in adjacent conquered territories (like western Germany or Spain) both
intentionally and unintentionally. A treatise by the German philosopher Fichte was
one of the first deliberate statements of nationalism and shows its intellectual bases;
two quick followups in later German history (one from the French revolutionary
period, one from the national unifications period of the 1860s) show how
nationalism could later be used. Finally, Simon Bolivar suggests the nature of Latin
American nationalism, as it was defined as part of the wars of independence.
Questions
1. How did the French Revolution stimulate nationalism both at home and in Europe
more generally? Did the revolutionaries see themselves as nationalists or
universalists?
2. How did the nationalism that emerged around the French Revolution relate to the
more explicit purposes of revolution discussed in the previous chapter?
3. What was Fichte’s philosophical basis for nationalism? What ideas was he arguing
against in promoting nationalism?
4. How did Frederick William reflect the impact of revolutionary ideas in urging
opposition to Napoleonic France? How and why did he suggest German

nationalism?
5. How did Bismarck define and use nationalism?
6. Did German nationalism remain consistent from Fichte through Frederick William
to Bismarck, or were there significant changes?
7. Looking at the French and the German documents, discuss how nationalism could
be both a liberal and a conservative force. Was German nationalism consistently
conservative?
8. How does Bolivar’s nationalism compare to the European versions? What special
Latin American issues does he reflect? Where does his nationalism fit on a liberalconservative spectrum?
For Further Discussion
1. What factors explain the rise of nationalism in Europe and theAmericas?
2. How and why could nationalism turn against liberal ideals?
3. Did leaders like Bolivar assume that Latin America was part of Western
civilization, or did they assume that it was very different? What civilizational
framework works best for understanding Latin American history in the nineteenth
century?
4. Are the forces that sustained nationalism declining in the twenty-first century?
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND NATIONALISM: A 1792 DECREE
The following decree came from the National Convention in France, elected in 1792.
France had begun to fight off foreign attack and had annexed Belgium in the
process; Belgian resistance stimulated the decree.
•••
The National Convention, having heard the report of its combined Committees of
Finance, War, and Diplomacy; faithful to the principles of the sovereignty of the
people, which do not permit it to recognize any institutions detrimental thereto, and
wishing to establish the rules to be followed by the generals of the armies of the
Republic in territories where they bear arms, decrees:
1. In territories which are or may be occupied by the armies of the Republic, the
generals shall proclaim immediately, in the name of the French nation, the
sovereignty of the people, the suppression of all established authorities and of
existing imposts or taxes, the [manorial] abolition of the tithe, of feudalism, of
seigniorial rights, … ofnobility, and generally of all privileges.
2. They shall announce to the people that they bring it peace, aid, fraternity,
liberty, and equality, and they shall convoke it thereafter in primary or communal
assemblies, in order to create and organize a provisional administration and justice;
they shall supervise the security of persons and property; they shall have the present
decree and the proclamation annexed thereto printed in the language or idiom of
the territory and posted and executed without delay in every commune.
3. All agents and civil or military officials of the former government, as well as
individuals heretofore considered noble, or members of any corporation heretofore
privileged, shall be, for this time only, inadmissible to vote in the primary or
communal assemblies, and they may not be elected to positions in the provisional
administration or judiciary.

4. The generals shall place, consecutively, under the safeguard and protection of
the French Republic all real and personal property belonging to the public treasury,
to the prince, his abettors, adherents, and voluntary satellites, to public
establishments, and to lay and ecclesiastical bodies and communities; they shall
have a detailed statement thereof drafted promptly and dispatched to the Executive
council, and they shall take all measure within their power in order that such
properties be respected.
5. The provisional administration, elected by the people, shall be responsible for
the surveillance and administration of matters placed under the safeguard and
protection of the French Republic; it shall supervise the security of persons and
property; it shall have the laws now in force relative to the trial of civil and criminal
suites, to the police, and to public security put into effect; it shall be in charge of
regulating and paying local expenses and those necessary for the common defense; it
may institute taxes, provided, however, that they are not borne by the indigent and
hard-working portion of the population.
From John Hall Stewart, ed., A Documentary Survey of the French Revolution (New
York: Macmillan, 1951), 381–84. Reprinted by permission of Pearson Education, Inc.

6. As soon as the provisional administration has been organized, the National
Convention shall appoint commissioners from within its own body to go to
fraternize with it.
7. The Executive Council also shall appoint national commissioners who shall go,
consecutively, to the places, to consult the generals and the provisional
administration elected by the people concerning measures to be taken for the
common defence and concerning the means to be employed to procure the clothing
and provisions necessary for the armies, and to pay ther [i.e., the armies’] expenses
during their sojourn on its territory.
Henceforth the French nation proclaims the sovereignty of the people, the
suppression of all civil and military authorities which have governed you up to the
present, and of all taxes which you sustain, in whatever form they exist; the
abolition of the tithe, of feudalism, of seigniorial rights, … fixed or contingent, of
banalités of real and personal servitude, of hunting and fishing privileges, [labor
service and all manorial taxes], and generally of every species of contributions with
which you have been burdened by your usurpers; it proclaims also the abolition
among you of every corporation, noble, sacerdotal, and others, of all prerogative
and privileges that are contrary to equality. You are henceforth, brothers and
friends, all citizens, all equal in rights, and all equally summoned to govern, to
serve, and to defend your Patrie [fatherland].
FICHTE
Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814) was a German philosopher who supported the
French Revolution and its ideals but then rethought his position as the French
extended controls over Germany. This address occurred in 1806, in French-occupied
Berlin.
•••
The first, original, and truly natural boundaries of states are beyond doubt their
internal boundaries. Those who speak the same language are joined to each other by
a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins;

they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves
understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and
an inseparable whole. Such a whole, if it wishes to absorb and mingle with itself any
other people of different descent and language, cannot do so without itself becoming
confused, in the beginning at any rate, and violently disturbing the even progress of
its culture. From this internal boundary, which is drawn by the spiritual nature of
man himself, the marking of the external boundary by dwelling place results as a
consequence; and in the natural view of things it is not because men dwell between
certain mountains and rivers that they are a people, but, on the contrary, men dwell
together—and, if their luck has so arranged it, are protected by rivers and mountain
—because they were a people already by a law of nature which is much higher.
From Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Addresses to the German Nation, ed. George A. Kelly
(New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1968), 19,091, 19,394, 19,798, in public domain.
Thus was the German nation place—sufficiently united within itself by a common
language and a common way of thinking, and sharply enough severed from the
other peoples—in the middle of Europe, as a wall to divide races not akin.…
That things should remain thus did not suit the selfishness of foreign countries,
whose calculations did not look more than one moment ahead. They found German
bravery useful in waging their wars and German hands useful to snatch the booty
from their rivals. A means had to be found to attain this end, and foreign cunning
won an easy victory over German ingenuousness and lack of suspicion. It was
foreign countries which first made use of the division of mind produced by religious
disputes in Germany—Germany, which presented on a small scale the features of
Christian Europe as a whole—foreign countries, I say, made use of these disputes to
break up the close inner unity of Germany into separate and disconnected parts.…
Now at last, let us be bold enough to look at the deceptive vision of a universal
monarchy, which people are beginning to hold up for public veration in place of
that equilibrium which for some time has been growing more and more
preposterous, and let us perceive how hateful and contrary to reason that vision is.…
Only when each people, left to itself, develops and forms itself in accordance with
its own peculiar quality, and only when in every people each individual develops
himself in accordance with that common quality, as well as in accordance with his
own peculiar quality—then, and then only, does the manifestation of divinity appear
in its true mirror as it ought to be. … Only in the invisible qualities of nations,
which are hidden from their own eyes—qualities as the means whereby these nations
remain in touch with the source of original life—only therein is to be found the
guarantee of their presence and future worth, virtue, and merit.
A PROCLAMATION BY THE PRUSSIAN KING, 1813
Frederick William was king of Prussia. He issued this proclamation as he prepared to
join the war against Napoleon. The Prussian monarchy had a long history of careful
military activity and promotion of its dynasty. The proclamation reflects the
monarch’s interest but in new ways that showed the influence of revolutionary
ideals, including nationalism.
•••
THE KING OF PRUSSIA ROUSES HIS PEOPLE AGAINST NAPOLEON

There is no need of explaining to my loyal subjects, or to any German, the reasons

for the war which is about to begin. They lie plainly before the eyes of awakened
Europe. We succumbed to the superior force of France. The peace which followed
deprived me of my people and, far from bringing us blessings, it inflicted upon us
deeper wounds than the war itself, sucking out the very marrow of the country. Our
principal fortresses remained in the hand of the enemy, and agriculture, as well as
the highly developed industries of our towns, was crippled. The freedom of trade
was hampered and thereby the sources of commerce and prosperity cut off. The
country was left a prey to the ravages of destitution.
I hoped, by the punctilious fulfillment of the engagements I had entered into, to
lighten the burdens of my people, and even to convince the French emporer that it
would be to his own advantage to leave Prussia her independence. But the purest
and best of intentions on my part were of no avail against insolence and
faithlessness, and it became only too plain that the emperor’s treaties would
gradually ruin us even more surely than his wars. The moment is come when we can
no longer harbor the slightest illusion as to our situation.
Brandenburgers, Prussians, Silesians, Pomeranians, Lithuanians! You know what
you have borne for the past seven years; you know the sad fate that awaits you if we
do not bring this war to a honorable end. Think of the times gone by,—of the Great
Elector, the great Frederick! Remember the blessings for which your forefathers
fought under their leadership and which they paid for with their blood,—freedom of
conscience, national honor, independence, commerce, industry, learning. Look at the
great example of our powerful allies, the Russians; look at the Spaniards, the
Portuguese. For such objects as these even weaker peoples have gone forth against
the mightier enemies and returned in triumph. Witness the heroic Swiss and the
people of the Netherlands.
Great sacrifices will be demanded from every class of the people, for our
undertaking is a great one, and the number and resources of our enemies far from
insignificant. But would you not rather make these sacrifices for the fatherland and
for your own rightful king than for a foreign ruler, who, as he has shown by many
examples, will use you and your sons and your uttermost farthing for ends which are
nothing to you?
Faith in God, perseverance, and the powerful aid of our allies will bring us victory
as the reward of our honest efforts. Whatever sacrifices may be required of us as
individuals, they will be outweighed by the sacred rights for which we make them,
and for which we must fight to a victorious end unless we are willing to cease to be
Prussians or Germans. This is the final, the decisive struggle; upon it depends on our
independence, our prosperity, our existence. There are no other alternatives but an
honorable peace or a heroic end. You would willingly face even the latter for
honor’s sake, for without honor no Prussian or German could live.
From James Harvey Robinson, ed., Readings in European History, vol. 2 (New York:
Ginn, 1928), 522–23.
However, we may confidently await the outcome. God and our own firm purpose
will bring victory to our cause and with it an assured and glorious peace and the
return of happier times.
Frederick William.
Breslau, March 17, 1813.
BISMARCK

Otto von Bismarck was the chief architect of German unification (1866–1871) from
a welter of individual kingdoms, the largest of which was Prussia. Bismarck used
nationalism, and German unification both built on and encouraged national
loyalties; but his own motiviations had more to do with enhancing Prussian power.
This brief comment suggests the complexities of his approach.
•••
In order that German patriotism should be active and effective, it needs as a rule to
hang on the peg of dependence upon a dynasty; independent of dynasty it rarely
comes to the rising point, though in theory it daily does so, in parliament, in the
press, in public meeting; in practice the German needs either attachment to a
dynasty or the goad of anger, hurrying him into action; the latter phenomenon,
however, by its own nature is not permanent. It is as a Prussian, a Hanoverian, a
Wurtemberger, a Bavarian or Hessian, rather than a German, that he is disposed to
give unequivocal proof of a patriotism; and in the lower orders and the
parliamentary groups it will be long before it is otherwise. We cannot say that the
Hanoverian, Hessian, and other dynasties were at any special pains to win the
affections of their subjects; but nevertheless the German patriotism of their subjects
is essentially conditioned by their attachment to the dynasty after which they call
themselves. … The German’s love of Fatherland has need of a prince on whom it can
concentrate its attachment. Suppose that all the German dynasties were suddenly
deposed; there would then be no likelihood that the German national sentiment
would suffice to hold all Germans together from the point of view of international
law amid the friction of European politics, even in the form of federated Hanse
towns and imperial village communes. The Germans would fall a prey to more
closely welded nations if they once lost the tie which resides in the princes’ sense of
community of rank. History shows for Germany the Prussian stock is that of which
the individual character is most strongly stamped.
From Otto von Bismarck, Memoirs (in Bismarck, The Man and the Statesman, New
York; Harper and Brothers, 1899).
POLITICAL IDEALS AND NATIONALISM IN LATIN AMERICA: SIMÓN BOLÍVAR
Simon Bolivar (1783–1830) was one of the principle leaders in Latin America’s
successful struggle for independence early in the nineteenth century. A Creole—that
is, American born but of European stock, Bolivar was keenly aware of the political
ideas of the European Enlightenment and the French and American Revolutions. He
led the battles against the Spaniards in Venezuela, Columbia, and the northern
Andes region, hoping to form one great state. He was selected as the initial leader
but was unable to maintain the political structure or the unity he had intended, as
the region soon split into separate, smaller countries. The following selections come
from a proclamation calling Venezuelans to arms in the fight against Spanish
occupation, which occurred in 1813, and an address to the legislature in Venezuela
soon after independence, in 1819.
•••
THE 1813 PROCLAMATION

Venezuelans: An army of your brothers, sent by the Sovereign Congress of New
Granada [present-day Columbia] has come to liberate you. Having expelled the
oppressors from the provinces of Mérida and Trujillo, it is now among you.

We are sent to destroy the Spaniards, to protect the Americans, and to reestablish
the republican governments that once formed the Confederation of Venezuela. The
states defended by our arms are again governed by their former constitutions and
tribunals, in full enjoyment of their liberty and independence, for our mission is
designed only to break the chains of servitude which still shackle some of our towns,
and not to impose laws or exercise acts of dominion to which the rules of war might
entitle us.
Moved by your misfortunes, we have been unable to observe with indifference the
afflictions you were forced to experience by the barbarous Spaniards, who have
ravished you, plundered you, and brought you death and destruction. They have
violated the sacred rights of nations. They have broken the most solemn agreements
and treaties. In fact, they have committed every manner of crime, reducing the
Republic of Venezuela to the most frightful desolation. Justice therefore demands
vengeance, and necessity compels us to exact it. Let the monsters who infest
Columbian soil, who have drenched it in blood, be cast out forever; may their
punishment be equal to the enormity of their perfidy, so that we may eradicate the
stain of our ignominy and demonstrate to the nations of the world that the sons of
America cannot be offended with impunity.
From Vicente Lecuna, ed., Selected Writings of Bolivar (New York: Colonial Press,
1951), 31–32.
Despite our just resentment toward the iniquitous Spaniards, our magnanimous
heart still commands us to open to them for the last time a path to reconciliation
and friendship; they are invited to live peacefully among us, if they will abjure their
crimes, honestly change their ways, and cooperate with us in destroying the
intruding Spanish government and in the reestablishment of the Republic of
Venezuela.
Any Spaniard who does not, by every active and effective means, work against
tyranny in behalf of this just cause, will be considered an enemy and punished; as a
traitor to the nation, he will inevitably be shot by a firing squad. On the other hand,
a general and absolute amnesty is granted to those who come over to our army with
or without their arms, as well as those who render aid to the good citizens who are
endeavoring to throw off the yoke of tyranny. Army officers and civil magistrates
who proclaim the government of Venezuela and join with us shall retain their
positions; in a word, those Spaniards who render outstanding service to the State
shall be regarded and treated as Americans.
And you Americans who, by error or treachery, have been lured from the paths of
justice, are informed that your brothers, deeply regretting the error of your ways,
have pardoned you as we are profoundly convinced that you cannot be truly to
blame, for only the blindness and ignorance in which you have been kept up to now
by those responsible for your crimes could have induced you to commit them. …
You are hereby assured, with absolute impunity, of your honor, lives, and property.
The single title, “Americans,” shall be your safeguard and guarantee. Our arms have
come to protect you, and they shall never be raised against a single one of you, your
brothers.
THE 1819 PROCLAMATION

We are not Europeans; we are not Indians; we are but a mixed species of aborigines
and Spaniards. Americans by birth and Europeans by law, we find ourselves engaged
in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership, and at

the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us
birth against the opposition of the invaders. Thus our position is most extraordinary
and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and
political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult
of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had
been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active
domestic tyranny. … We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have
been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of
darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition
and intrigue abuse the credulity and experience of men lacking all political,
economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license
for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people perverted
by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it
would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the
practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants,
because as the laws are more inflexible, everyone should submit to their beneficent
austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to
practice justice is to practice liberty.
From: Simón Bolívar, An Address of Bolivar at the Congress of Angostura, February
15, 1819. (Reprint ed., Washington, D.C.: Press of B.S. Adams, 1919), passim.
Although those people [North Americans], so lacking in many respects, are
unique in the history of mankind, it is a marvel, I repeat, that so weak and
complicated a government as the federal system has managed to govern them in the
difficult and trying circumstances of their past. But, regardless of the effectiveness of
this form of government with respect to North America, I must say that it has never
for a moment entered my mind to compare the position and character of two states
as dissimilar as the English-American and the Spanish-American. Would it not be
most difficult to apply to Spain the English system of political, civil, and religious
liberty: Hence, it would be even more difficult to adapt to Venezuela the laws of
North America.

CHAPTER 23
THE OPIUM WAR
Chinese and English Views
One of the key events in nineteenth-century history was the West’s forcing open of
China. Like the Crusades many centuries before (see chapter 10), when Europe
attacked Islam, the confrontation of the West and China allows a comparison of two
societies’ reactions to a single event. Unlike the Crusades, however, this event
involved a decisive Western victory and a lasting impact on China because that
society was on the losing end. The whole episode was a crucial stage in expanding
Western imperialism. Comparison facilitates understanding imperialism from two
sides rather than accepting a winner’s narrative alone, while also suggesting some
reasons for later Chinese policies devoted to eliminating outside control.
Since the rise of the West in the world trade in the fifteenth century, China had
adopted a cautious policy, trading actively but with careful supervision of contacts.
The nation had no need for Western goods, and it distrusted these aggressive
barbarians. British requests for access to Chinese markets were rudely declined as
late as 1796: China could stand alone.
Two developments altered this situation by the 1830s. In the first place, China’s
government was weakening, its hold over its bureaucracy and its tax revenues both
slipping. The desire to maintain a traditional policy of isolation and rebuff
remained, but the ability to implement it had declined.
More important was the greater strength of Britain and the West, thanks to early
industrialization. The West had more wealth, which created a greater appetite for
Chinese luxury goods such as silk and porcelain. It engaged in more production,
which aroused some interest in gaining access to Chinese markets. It had better
technology and better and more abundant armaments, which meant it could now
give the Chinese a run for their money if it came to battle.
It was still true that the West had little to offer China economically, for the great
empire had its own preindustrial manufacturing and elaborate internal trade. That is
why the final ingredient to this unhappy puzzle involved pressure to sell opium. All
these elements drew together in the first (of two) opium wars in the late 1830s. With
a small military force, the British compelled the Chinese to back down; China began
to be open to foreign trade, though a second war was needed to confirm these
results. The Opium War, in turn, was not only pivotal in Chinese history, ushering in
many decades of disarray and Western intervention. It also signaled the beginning of
the massive nineteenth-century explosion of European imperialism virtually
worldwide.
Between 1839 and 1842, British forces, supplemented by other Western troops,
successfully battled Chinese coastal contingents over the right to import opium and
more generally to trade freely in China. The war demonstrated that the West could
easily capture coastal cities. Chinese opposition to Western demands was based on
its long-standing suspicion of foreigners (“barbarians”) and foreign trade, plus a
keen awareness of the effects of opium, which had not been widely used before the
late eighteenth century. The imperial government attempted to assert its normal
strong control over internal affairs. Britain was battling for access to lucrative
Chinese products and markets, the old commercial goal that Western military

superiority could not attain. Opium, produced in British holdings in India, was a
desirable means of earning Chinese currency to exchange for eagerly sought silks
and craft goods—for the Chinese were not wildly enthusiastic about what the West
itself had for sale. The war began a process of growing Western interference and
internal confusion as China was reluctantly dragged into new international
involvements.
Views of the war varied. The first selections reflect the official policy, backed by
centuries of imperial confidence and responsibility. But reports from officials on the
spot show the nation’s weakness in fact, which made the emperor’s goals
unrealizable. An English participant, J. Elliot Bingham, gives an English explanation,
offering a much different view of the opium issue, the quality of Chinese society,
and the benefits of Western power. It is a classic imperialist statement. How does it
compare to the views about non-Westerners prevalent in the slave trade and the
conquest of the Americas (chapters 16 and 17)? Finally, a reforming official, Wei
Yuan, offers a plan in 1842 for reviving China and defeating the West. His views
long remained unheeded.
Questions
1. What was official Chinese policy? How did it reflect traditional Confucian ideas
about the role and legitimacy of government? How did the emperor evaluate the
Europeans (called barbarians by the Chinese)?
2. What kind of concessions did the imperial commissioner urge in 1842? What were
his motives?
3. How did a British official justify the use of force and the sale of opium to the
Chinese? How did his view of the Chinese compare with the Chinese view of the
Europeans?
4. On what bases did the British now find the Chinese inferior? What, according to
Bingham, might ultimately bring the Chinese up to civilized levels? What evidence
does Bingham offer about why the British were now able to defeat the Chinese?
5. Is Bingham a characteristic European imperialist, in his motives and his
arguments? Using his statements, how would you define the imperialist approach?
6. What were the key ingredients of Wei Yuan’s Defense Plan? What elements of
traditional Chinese policy does he propose to change? Would his reforms have
gone far enough to make China capable of resisting further European
intervention? How would Bingham react to Wei Yuan’s plan?
For Further Discussion
1. What impact did the Opium War have on long-term Chinese attitudes toward the
West? Would China (and the eventual Chinese-Western relations) have been better
served if the West had simply taken the nation over as a colony, as was done with
India, rather than exploiting it economically without taking full responsibility?
2. Was Wei Yuan proposing a “modernization” of China? Why did China not at least
quickly move to accept this kind of strategy? Why was China slow to reform, at a
time when the West and other neighboring societies were clearly changing so
rapidly?
3. Did many Westerners really believe their own rationales for imperialism, or was
this simply a naked power grab?
4. How would a British history and a Chinese history, using these documents around

1900, when imperialist assumptions still reigned in Europe, differ in their accounts
of the Opium War?
CHINA: OFFICIAL STATEMENTS
The following two documents, both issued in 1842 after the war had begun, come
respectively from the emperor himself, outlining an official policy of resistance, and
from a regional commissioner reporting on the actual course of the fighting.
•••
IMPERIAL EDICT TO THE GRAND SECRETARIAT, JUNE 5, 1842

On account of the widespread evil of opium in depraving the lives of our people, I
issued edicts in a preceding year commanding the various provinces strictly to
prohibit the drug. The warning was repeated many times thereafter. And since
Canton is the port where the outer barbarians come to trade, Lin Tsê-hsü was
specially delegated to go there to examine the affairs. The barbarian merchants of
all nations obeyed the restrictions imposed by the Commissioner. The English
barbarian rebel Elliot alone started disturbances on the pretext that our government
had destroyed their opium.…
From P. C. Kuo, A Critical Study of the First Anglo-Chinese War (Shanghai:
Commercial Press, 1935), 289–92, 293, 296, 298. Reproduced by permission of the
Commercial Press (Hong Kong) Limited.
Yet the rebellious barbarians were cunning and fickle. Their demands knew no
bounds. They evidently knew that Yishan was bent upon peaceful diplomacy and
that he was not backed by force. Hence they dared to start hostilities by suddenly
attacking the forts at Taikok and Shakok, killing our officials and disturbing the
inhabitants. It is thus apparent that the rebellious barbarians began hostilities on
account of smuggling opium. Then, they pretended to request favors, while in the
meantime they enfolded their dark schemes. Such sheer insincerity and ingratitude
should arouse the wrath of both the gods and men. When I called forth our punitive
expedition, it was prompted by this consideration.
Later, when Yishan and his colleagues arrived at Canton, the rebellious barbarians
had invaded the inner river and were besieging the provincial city itself. The
provincial authorities thereupon agreed that the rebels sought only material profit
and wished the restoration of trade. They prayed that the [merchant] debts be paid
back to them. As I always treated things with true generosity, I thought that this
negligible sum hardly deserved much consideration and that it was certainly not
worth while to find an enemy in these rotten people, if by the grant the barbarians
would abstain from creating further troubles. Thus again, I made an unusual
concession out of a love for the lives of our people.
But, contrary to my expectations, the barbarians cherished mischievous ideas,
offending heaven and ignoring reason itself. For no sooner had they composed the
quarrels at Canton than fresh troubles arose in Fukien and Chekiang. They invaded
Tinghai for the second time and took other cities in succession. It led to the suicide
of our Governor and the martyrdom of our generals. The guilt of their depredation
upon the lives of our people was beyond the power of redemption.
Therefore, we dispatched Yikin and others to extirpate them with our troops.
During the past few months, the enemy withdrew from Ningpo, but captured Chapu
in its stead. Thus these rebels first begged our favors while in Canton and fled. Then,

in Chekiang, they filled their stores by robbery or depredation. Judged by their
rapacious conduct, their guilt has really amounted to the full measure. While it will
certainly receive the punishment from the heaven, yet there is no reason why the
people should suffer this wise.
When I deliberate upon this situation, I feel tormented by it. So long as the evil
were not eradicated, there is no salvation for the sufferings of the people. I censure
myself for the inadequacy of my virtue, and can scarcely rest in peace. The generals,
secretaries, governors, and all other officials should understand my mind and strive
to relieve the sufferings of the people. They should not procrastinate, lest they
should spoil the situation at present. Nor should they hope to evade their duties, lest
they should perpetuate ill repute in the future.
As to the officers and soldiers in the army, there is a current belief among them
that the sturdy ships and fierce cannons of the barbarians are irresistible. Hence,
they gave up fighting the moment they saw the enemies on the battlefields. But they
should know that the cause of the invasion of the enemies was our concession at the
beginning. Should every one go forth bravely and with the coöperation of the village
braves, it must be obvious that not only there is great difference between us the
hosts and them the strangers, but also there is no comparison between the numerical
strength of the two parties. Fighting with the advantage of knowing our own
geography, there is no difficulty for us to achieve success. Thus it is apparent that
the violence of the rebellious barbarians is all attributable to the inefficiency of our
own troops.…
I am the ruler of all the people. If I should be content with peace for the time
being, and not seek for the great and the far, and let the evil of the opium go its way
without any prohibition, that would mean that I am betraying my ancestors who
intrusted to me the care of the empire, and that I am unable to afford due protection
to the lives of my subjects. Thinking about these points, how can I rest without
strictly prohibiting it, how dare I not strictly prohibit it?
Although the barbarians are becoming daily more violent and rapacious, you
commanders and governors, occupying important posts of the government, should
arouse your conscience and enforce the laws of prohibition with vigor. Those who
exert their energy will certainly receive rewards. Those who procrastinate will
likewise receive penalties. When things are conducted this wise, I see no reason what
attack launched by us cannot achieve success, nor what defense made by us is not
impregnable.…
In a word, the prohibition of opium has its object in the saving of the lives of the
people, while the defense against the invaders has its object in the protection of the
same. I am obsessed by these tasks all the time. You ministers of the state must alike
give united support to the cause, encouraging the troops to fight with persistence.
Certainly it will result in the extermination of the rebels, and the eradication of
violence along the coast. By that time, all of us can share with the people a universal
peace.
REPORTS BY KIYING, IMPERIAL COMMISSIONER, 1842

As I examined into the said principles, I found that they truly indicate, as your
Majesty had said, their [Western] insistence upon material profit. I believed that it
was a good occasion for us to get them under our control.…
… Should we still persist in resistance and should the city fall to the barbarians,
the loss of our own lives is an insignificant matter. But we fear that once this city,

the metropolis of three provinces, should be upset, not only would the route of
Chinkiang be cut off, but the barbarians could easily sail direct to the capitals of
Anhwei, Kiangsi, and Hupeh. Moreover, according to a report of the magistrate of
Yangchow, Pang I-chu, the barbarians had declared that if they fight and lose, they
will employ native traitors to instigate troubles from within. Should this be true, the
disaster would be still more inconceivable.
We believe that, although the demands of the barbarians are indeed rapacious, yet
they are little more than a desire for ports and for the privilege of trade. There are
no dark schemes in them. Compared with war which will inevitably entail great
disasters, we would rather see assent be given to their demands, and thus save the
whole country south of the Yangtze.…
In settling the barbarian affairs this time, we are governed at every hand by the
inevitable and we concede that the policy is the least commendable. What we have
been doing is to choose between danger and safety, not between right and wrong.
For instance, the barbarians asked for as many as 21,000,000 dollars, and five ports.
Although we are ignorant, yet we realize that the public revenues of our government
are limited, that the coastal frontiers are important, and that we should not give
concessions easily. But the spirit of the invaders is running high. They occupy our
important cities. The illness on the limbs is becoming one in the heart of a person.
Should we fail to take advantage of the present occasion, and to ease the situation
by soothing the barbarians, they will run over our country like beasts, doing
anything they like.
Moreover, during the past two years, we assembled the troops of several
provinces. No matter whether it was for extirpation or for defense, it was of no
avail. At present, the additional warships of the barbarians have almost doubled the
number they used to have before. If it should happen that Nanking falls, they can
easily ascend the river. The waters are deep and the banks extended; while the spots
of defense are scattered, the man power available at each point must necessarily be
feeble. It would be hard to erect forts at one stroke. Judged by these circumstances,
the possibilities of victory or defeat must be manifest. Should their force cut off our
communication between the south and the north, it is still more difficult to foretell
the disasters.
The ships of the barbarians are sturdy and their cannons fierce. Previously this
was only hearsay. But now we have been on their ships and personally have seen
their cannons. After this experience, we are the more convinced that we cannot
control them by force. It is because of the inevitable that we asked, in our previous
memorial, to grant large sums of money in order to save the country.
BRITAIN: A VIEW FROM A PARTICIPANT
J. Elliot Bingham was a navy officer and the son of a clergyman (the latter fact is
particularly interesting in view of some of his moralizing statements and moral
blind spots). Bingham wrote his account right after the war, seeking to glorify the
British cause to an adoring public back home—though popular enthusiasm for
imperialism was not yet at the pitch it would attain a few decades later.
•••
Now it might be supposed from the foregoing extracts, that the Chinese have been
very ill-used, and that the opium trade has been forced on them; but such was not at
all the case. I must beg my readers to divest themselves of such an idea; for be it

remembered, while the Chinese statesmen pencil their highly moral edicts and
memorials with one hand against the admission of this poisonous drug, with the
other they receive bribes and fees, levied for the secret admission of this baneful
enchantment. Nay, they themselves, in secret, revel in all the luxury of the opium
pipe; a luxury which, when once indulged in, it is almost impossible to shake off.…
To suppress this traffic is utterly impossible, until the whole character of the
Chinese nation becomes altered. Opium they will have; and experience has proved
that all the obstacles and difficulties thrown in the way of its introduction have only
tended to increase it, and extend its use. It would be just as easy to put down beer
and gin drinking in England. I much question whether there are not as many English
gin sufferers as there are Chinese opium sufferers, for the opium is used by them in
the least deleterious manner, viz., by smoking.
But, as I have before observed, it is not the question of health or morality with
the Chinese. The fact is, our imports have given a great balance in our favour, as is
shown in the following table:—
Our purchases for the year ending June 30, 1838, for teas, silk, and
all other articles, amount to ......................

£.
3,147,481

Our sales of opium, metals, and cotton, to ................

5,637,052

Balance in favour of British ........................

2,489,571

which was generally paid in sycee, the export of which, in 1837–8, amounted to
nearly nine millions of dollars.
Thus we see what was the chief and true reason for attempting to stop the trade
in opium, and accordingly the edicts previously or subsequently to this year,
enlarged more on the abstraction of the sycee than on the morals of the people.…
Active hostilities therefore ceased, and the Emperor’s assent to the provisions of
the treaty having been intimated by an imperial edict on the 29th, vessels were
despatched to the different Chinese ports to remove the embargoes on their trade.
During the preliminary arrangements of peace the Chinese authorities visited the
Cornwallis, where they were received in great state and shown round the ship. The
formidable appointments of the barbarian sanpan somewhat astonished the mind of
their excellencies, while bumpers of cherry brandy upset the equilibrium of several
jolly members of their suite. The entertainment was duly returned, when shamsoo
took the place of cherry brandy.…
From John Elliot Bingham, Narrative of the Expedition to China from the
Commencement of the War to Its Termination in 1842. … (London: Henry Colburn,
1843), 22–23, 34–39, 363–66, 369–72.
Conclusion
The dispute with “the celestial empire” having been brought, by the energetic
measures of our present Government, to a triumphant conclusion, and that, not so
much by the mere destruction of junks and forts as by the consequent pressure on
the trade of the country, nothing more remains for me to do, than to offer a few
general remarks in concluding this narrative of events.
The military tactics of the Chinese must be regarded as far below mediocrity; and
can it be otherwise with a people, among whom the recommendation of a general
for employment is not his intimate acquaintance with the arts of war, but rather his

acuteness to frame and his effrontery to utter the most unblushing falsehoods, in
order to deceive his opponents? No deceit is too gross, no artifice too mean and
dirty for a mandarin, whether soldier, magistrate, or statesman, to stoop to. The
following Chinese maxim illustrates the justness of this stricture:—“When the
territory of our sovereign is in difficulty we ought immediately to deliver it. What
would be the use of adhering bigotedly to a little bit of good faith, thereby involving
doubts and delays?”
That individuals possessing personal courage are to be found, both among Chinese
and Tartars, many a single combat has shown. The latter, indeed, both at Chapoo
and Tchang-kiang, when all retreat was cut off, fought with a determination that
was not expected. However, upon giving the subject our consideration, we shall find
that this originated not so much from the esprit de corps of soldiers, as from the
desperation of men fighting for their wives and children, whom they fully expected
would be treated by their conquerors with the same inhuman barbarity as they
would have inflicted upon us, had we lost the day. … And most assuredly they
would have made us pay; for hundreds of English would have been chopped up at
Pekin to evince the triumph of the empire over the rebel barbarians.
“The Chinese,” says the late Doctor Morrison, who had ample opportunity of
forming a correct opinion, “are specious, but insincere, jealous, envious, and
distrustful to a high degree; they are generally selfish, coldblooded, and inhuman.”
Can we, I would add, accord to them a single virtue? We might allow them one,
filial affection, if that virtue, great and redeeming as it would otherwise be, did not
arise more from the force of education and habit, than from the outpouring of a
generous and humane heart.
The losses of the enemy, to say nothing of the wounded (vast numbers of whom
probably died), cannot have fallen much short of twenty thousand, exclusive of such
as perished by disease. This must of course be regarded as a rough calculation, their
habit of carrying off their killed and wounded whenever by any exertion they could
do so, rendering it impossible in any one instance to discover the exact number of
the slain. Much as we may lament the necessity of inflicting so severe a chastisement
on a people whose rulers alone were in fault, these losses are but a mere drop in
comparison of the resources of an empire which maintains at least one million of
men for military service, whom it draws from one-third of the human race. … It
may also behoove us to maintain for some time a commanding force in the China
seas, not forgetting the perfidious character of a nation who, having despised us
before as barbarians, now hate us as their conquerors. It will be long ere their pride
will forgive us for the humiliating discipline we have applied to them.
It will be our wisdom, however, to maintain the vantage ground which, through
the blessing of the Almighty upon our arms, we have acquired, as well as to embrace
every opportunity of making them understand the real character of the great nation
they have to deal with; and in order to do this, we must treat them with firmness
combined with liberality. Let us hope that the way may thus be opened for
enlightening their minds with the truths of that Christianity which is the real basis of
Britain’s glory.
Much opposed as the government of China has ever been to the Christian religion,
I do not despair of the arrival of that day, when under the influence of the spirit of
the Most High the disciples of Christ shall abound and be protected even in the cities
of “the central flowery land.” Why should not Japan too, ere long, under the results
of similar operations, be induced to open her ports to the Christian trader, and

respect that cross of Christ on which she now tramples?…
WEI YUAN’S DEFENSE PLAN, 1842
Wei Yuan was a government official, trained in Confucianism, writing in the wake of
China’s defeat in the first Opium War. He proposed to the emperor a number of
changes, both in diplomacy and in military policy. His ideas were far too
imaginative for a conservative, weak government to accept. Nevertheless, some of
his proposals contain some interesting mistakes, particularly in Russian and Indian
geography; why was an otherwise alert official in China prone to mistakes of this
sort?
•••
India is on the southwest of the Onion Range, and adjacent to our further Tibet, the
Gurkhas, and Burma. From the homeland of the British barbarians, India is several
myriad li. The British barbarians used warships and occupied the three parts of
India, in the east, the south, and center. The Russian troops then, from the space
between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, attacked and subdued the various
nomadic tribes and made connection with the two western and central parts of
India. They were only separated by the Himalayas. Each side was guarded by heavy
garrisons of troops. From Bengal to Malwa in East India and from Bombay to
Madras in South India opium is prevalent. The British barbarians annually collect
from opium taxes more than ten million (taels) silver, and the Russians are jealous.
When the British barbarians mobilized Indian … troops and warships to invade
China, they were greatly afraid that Russia might take advantage of their weakness
to invade Hindustan.… Therefore, the British barbarians’ fear of Russia lies not in
her national capital but in India. This is one opportunity which might be used.…

There is no better method of attacking England by sea than to use France and
America. France is very close to the English barbarians, being separated only by an
arm of the sea. America and the English barbarians, on the other hand, are separated
by a great ocean. Beginning from the period at the end of the Ming and the
beginning of this dynasty, France colonized the northeast territory of America. Cities
and towns were built, markets and ports were opened. The British barbarians
suddenly attacked and seized them. Thereupon the French barbarians and the
English barbarians became bitter enemies.…
Let us establish a shipyard and an arsenal at two spots, Chuenpi and Taikoktow
outside of the Bogue in Kwangtung, and select one or two persons from among the
foreign headmen who have come from France and America, respectively, to bring
Western craftsmen to Canton to take charge of building ships and making arms. In
addition, we should invite Western helmsmen to take charge of teaching the
methods of navigating ships and of using cannon, following the precedent of the
barbarian officials in the Imperial Board of Astronomy. We should select clever
artisans and good soldiers from Fukien and Kwangtung to learn from them, the
craftsmen to learn the casting of cannon and building of ships, and the good soldiers
to learn their methods of navigating and attack. … In Kwangtung there should be
ten thousand soldiers; in Fukien, ten thousand; in Chekiang, six thousand; and in

Kiangsu, four thousand. In assigning soldiers to the ships we must rely on selection
and training.… Eight out of ten should be taken from among the fishermen and
smugglers along the sea coast. Two out of ten should be taken from the old
encampments of the water forces. All the padded rations and extra rations of the
water force should be… used for the recruiting and maintenance of good soldiers.
We must make the water forces of China able to navigate large (lit., “storied”) ships
overseas, and able to fight against foreign barbarians on the high seas.

CHAPTER 24
THE EMANCIPATIONS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES
Widespread abolition of slavery and serfdom in the nineteenth century was one of
the big developments in world history. Documents in this section encourage
discussion of the reasons for this change; the actual nature of the change; and the
gaps between reform professions and actual results—all in a comparative context.
Latin American countries abolished slavery between 1810 and 1890, and the
institution was also attacked in Africa. Serfdom ended in Europe. Forms of work and
power that had existed virtually since the origin of civilization were opposed and
put down.
Historians continue to debate the origins of the unprecedented movement to
abolish the most blatant forms of coercive labor. New democratic and humanitarian
ideals played a role. Christian humanitarians began agitating against the Atlantic
slave trade in the late eighteenth century. Enlightenment political theorists joined in.
Russian reformers picked up these sentiments as well, urging fundamental reform in
Russia; American abolitionists stepped up the attack on slavery in the United States
by the 1820s (after many northern states had ended the institution in the wake of
the American Revolution). But new ideas, sincerely held, were not the only
motivation. Some historians also point to the importance of new forms of capitalist
labor, which demonstrated that workers could be exploited as “free” wage labor and
that slavery might in fact not be efficient enough for the commercial needs of the
nineteenth century. Antislavery campaigns might also distract industrial workers
from their own plight, by pointing to miseries elsewhere. Rising global population
levels provided alternative sources of labor.
Discussions of the complex causes of the emancipation current relate also to the
question of results. On paper, emancipation ended legal servitude. But even the
humanitarians had not necessarily thought much about the real conditions that
would prevail for former serfs and slaves. And powerful interested parties, such as
the estate owners, had obvious reasons to try to limit the impact of change.
Emancipation, though real, in this sense set up further problems.
Russia, the United States, and Brazil in the nineteenth century invite comparison.
All three were huge, expanding countries beginning to have a growing impact in
world affairs. All three abolished deeply rooted labor systems between 1800 and
1890, but all three faced important social tensions thereafter.
Two major moves occurred almost simultaneously: Russia’s Emancipation of the
Serfs in 1861 and Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. Circumstances
differed. Lincoln acted during civil war, to rally support for the Union cause. Russia
hoped to reduce peasant discontent and also build a more flexible economy and
labor force, as it lagged behind industrial Western Europe. Russia was spurred by its
embarrassing loss to Britain and France in the Crimean War (1854–55), which
seemed to prove that change was essential. But some similar humanitarian ideals
were involved in each case, at least on the part of certain reformers, plus a belief
that “free” wage labor was economically more productive than its forced equivalent.
What are the professed intentions behind the two emancipations, as reflected in the
initial documents below? Are they part of a single movement in world history, in
two rather different societies? Brazil’s movement came later, but with much less

debate. It too, however, can be compared with other emancipations in terms of
principles, process, and probable results.
Both Russia and the United States experienced continued disruption after these
major reforms. Russian serfs immediately complained of mistreatment, and their
protest continued for decades. As Southern whites regained political control in the
1870s after the Reconstruction period ended, African Americans in the region
experienced a loss of economic opportunities and other rights. Why was reform
incomplete in both countries? Brazilian ex-slaves faced economic challenges as well
in a society that defined racism differently than the United States did. Today, AfroBrazilians with darker skin color continue to face discrimination, but there is less
sense that having some African ancestry puts everyone in a single racial category.
Questions
1. How do the three emancipations compare? How do their justifications differ?
Which pays more attention to the conditions likely to result from emancipation?
In what sense can all three reform measures be judged to be rather limited, despite
their role in ending long-standing institutions of labor?
2. Why did Russia’s peasants begin immediately protesting the conditions of
emancipation? What institution did they think could fix the problems? Why did
the kinds of problems and expectations expressed in these protests ultimately—a
half-century later—help lead to revolution?
3. In what ways did black protest in the American South differ from that of the
Russian peasants? What were some similar complaints?
4. What happened to the social structure (class, or race) of the three societies after
emancipation? How did postemancipation reactions of the Russian aristocracy and
the Southern planter class compare? Was either more violent than the other—and
if so, for what reasons?
5. Why were there such gaps between the apparent intent of emancipations and their
actual results?
6. To what extent was Brazilian emancipation distinctive? What are the likely causes
of distinctiveness?
For Further Discussion
1. What caused the emancipation movements? Were the causes basically the same in
Russia, the United States, and Brazil?
2. Which political system was more open to protest, that of Russia or that of the
United States? Why did the protests of former serfs in Russia ultimately lead to
revolution, whereas protests by former slaves in the United States did not?
3. On balance, did reform fail or succeed in Russia? In the United States? In either
case, can you think of ways reform could have been done more successfully, with
better long-term results?
4. What results did Brazilian emancipation and the abolitionism that preceded it
suggest for freed slaves and the postslavery economy?
THE EMANCIPATION MANIFESTO, 1861
Russia’s emancipation of the serfs had been debated off and on for almost a century,
as a reform element developed in the Western-oriented aristocracy. The loss of the
Crimean War, when the industrially sustained armies of Britain and France beat

Russia on its own southern border, accelerated the discussion. A new, reform-minded
czar, Alexander II, resolved to act. The measure was the first of many reforms over
the next two decades. Nonetheless, the emancipation clearly took into account the
vital position of the Russian nobility; it was not intended to be a social revolution.
•••
By the Grace of God We, Alexander II, Emperor and Autocrat of All Russia, King of
Poland, Grand Duke of Finland, etc., make known to all Our faithful subjects:
Called by Divine Providence and by the sacred right of inheritance to the throne
of Our Russian ancestors, We vowed in Our heart to respond to the mission which is
entrusted to Us and to surround with Our affection and Our Imperial solicitude all
Our faithful subjects of every rank and condition, from the soldier who nobly
defends the country to the humble artisan who works in industry; from the career
official of the state to the plowman who tills the soil.
From Basil Dmytryshyn, Imperial Russia: A Sourcebook, 1700–1917 (New York:
Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1967), 221–23, 225.
Examining the condition of classes and professions comprising the state, We
became convinced that the present state legislation favors the upper and middle
classes, defines their obligations, rights, and privileges, but does not equally favor
the serfs, so designated because in part from old laws and in part from custom they
have been hereditarily subjected to the authority of landowners, who in turn were
obligated to provide for their well being. Rights of nobles have been hitherto very
broad and legally ill defined, because they stem from tradition, custom, and the
good will of the noblemen. In most cases this has led to the establishment of good
patriarchal relations based on the sincere, just concern and benevolence on the part
of the nobles, and on affectionate submission on the part of the peasants. Because of
the decline of the simplicity of morals, because of an increase in the diversity of
relations, because of the weakening of the direct paternal attitude of nobles toward
the peasants, and because noble rights fell sometimes into the hands of people
exclusively concerned with their personal interests, good relations weakened. The
way was opened for an arbitrariness burdensome for the peasants and detrimental to
their welfare, causing them to be indifferent to the improvement of their own
existence.…
We thus became convinced that the problem of improving the condition of serfs
was a sacred inheritance bequeathed to Us by Our predecessors, a mission which, in
the course of events, Divine Providence has called upon Us to fulfill.
We have begun this task by expressing Our confidence toward the Russian
nobility, which has proven on so many occasions its devotion to the Throne, and its
readiness to make sacrifices for the welfare of the country.
We have left to the nobles themselves, in accordance with their own wishes, the
task of preparing proposals for the new organization of peasant life—proposals that
would limit their rights over the peasants, and the realization of which would inflict
on them [the nobles] some material losses. Our confidence was justified. Through
members of the gubernia committees, who had the trust of the nobles’ associations,
the nobility voluntarily renounced its right to own serfs. These committees, after
collecting the necessary data, have formulated proposals on a new arrangement for
serfs and their relationship with the nobles.
These proposals were diverse, because of the nature of the problem. They have
been compared, collated, systematized, rectified and finalized in the main

committee instituted for that purpose; and these new arrangements dealing with the
peasants and domestics of the nobility have been examined in the Governing
Council.
Having invoked Divine assistance, We have resolved to execute this task.
On the basis of the above mentioned new arrangements, the serfs will receive in
time the full rights of free rural inhabitants.
The nobles, while retaining their property rights on all the lands belonging to
them, grant the peasants perpetual use of their domicile in return for a specified
obligation; and, to assure their livelihood as well as to guarantee fulfillment of their
obligations toward the government, [the nobles] grant them a portion of arable land
fixed by the said arrangements, as well as other property.
While enjoying these land allotments, the peasants are obliged, in return, to fulfill
obligations to the noblemen fixed by the same arrangements. In this state, which is
temporary, the peasants are temporarily bound.
At the same time, they are granted the right to purchase their domicile, and, with
the consent of the nobles, they may acquire in full ownership the arable lands and
other properties which are allotted them for permanent use. Following such
acquisition of full ownership of land, the peasants will be freed from their
obligations to the nobles for the land thus purchased and will become free peasant
landowners.…
We leave it to the nobles to reach a friendly understanding with the peasants and
to reach agreements on the extent of the land allotment and the obligations
stemming from it, observing, at the same time, the established rules to guarantee the
inviolability of such agreements.…
What legally belongs to nobles cannot be taken away from them without
adequate compensation, or through their voluntary concession; it would be contrary
to all justice to use the land of the nobles without assuming responsibility for it.
And now We confidently expect that the freed serfs, on the eve of a new future
which is opening to them, will appreciate and recognize the considerable sacrifices
which the nobility has made on their behalf.
THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, 1862
Abraham Lincoln did not come easily to the decision to emancipate the slaves. He
was opposed to slavery, but his opinions had wavered over his adult life. He believed
in property, and he did not want to antagonize the South more than necessary. But
in the second year of the Civil War, with northern abolitionists pressing for action, it
became clear that emancipation might improve support for the war and also help
raise black resistance in the South, thus weakening the secessionist war effort.
Lincoln’s proclamation differed from the czar’s in many ways, reflecting a very
different political and religious system. But it expressed some similar cautions. As in
Russia, this reform was followed by others, when the North took over the South
during the Reconstruction period. As in Russia also, the reform era ended by the late
1870s or the 1880s.
•••
Whereas on the 22d day of September, A.D. 1862, a proclamation was issued by the
President of the United States, containing, among other things, the following, to wit:
“That on the 1st day of January, A.D. 1863, all persons held as slaves within any

State or designated part of a State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion
against the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the
executive government of the United States, including the military and naval
authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will
do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may
make for their actual freedom.…
And by virtue of the power and for the purpose aforesaid, I do order and declare
that all persons held as slaves within said designated States and parts of States are,
and henceforward shall be, free; and that the Executive Government of the United
States, including the military and naval authorities thereof, will recognize and
maintain the freedom of said persons.
And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all
violence, unless in necessary self-defense; and I recommend to them that, in all cases
when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages.
And I further declare and make known that such persons of suitable condition
will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts,
positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.
And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the
Constitution upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind
and the gracious favor of Almighty God.
JOACHIM NABUCO AND BRAZILIAN ABOLITIONISM
Joachim Nabuco was a leader in Brazilian abolitionism after a failed effort in 1871.
The following extracts were part of a book he published in 1881 in which he lays
out his arguments against slavery and his vision of a postslavery Brazil.
•••
The need for rapid abolition is recognized by all who are dissatisfied with the
concept of Brazil as a new [colonial economy] in America. The necessity of this
operation has been demonstrated, just as surgical science can prove the need to
amputate a gangrenous arm or leg in order to save a human life.
Unfortunately for slavery, however, as it undermined the entire nation, it
weakened itself as well; while corrupting everything else, it was also self-corrupting.
As a result, [this] proslavery army is a mixed and undisciplined mob eager to flee
the field of combat. The clientele of slavery are ashamed of living upon the scraps
they are tossed, of depending upon slavery’s indulgence. The people who survive like
vagrants on lands not their own, when given the hope of legitimately possessing
those lands where they are now suffered to squat as pariahs, will reject their present
serflike status.

In regard to the several social forces, slavery has made them so weak, timid, and
unreliable that they will be the first to welcome any change which brings their own
downfall and reconstructs them with new elements.…
Public opinion, as it is now developing, possesses strength and has its effects upon
the government. It represents the nation before the world, holds within its grasp the
leadership of a huge political complex which would be amenable to emancipation if

it were not for the coffee districts in the provinces of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and
Rio de Janeiro, a political mass which is each day more and more impelled by the
national conscience to abandon the orbit which slavery marked out for it.
However vast the power of slavery, however impressive the credit it can
command in the banks, however huge the value of its mortgaged estates, it stands
like a dogmatic aberration in the face of established truth. An ounce of science is
worth more, in the final analysis, than a ton of faith. Similarly, the smallest particle
of high-minded sentiment on behalf of humanity will eventually destroy the largest
monopoly erected against humanity’s interests. I do not attribute any metaphysical
power to principles when there is nobody to impose them, when the human mass to
which such principles might be applied is unreceptive to them. Yet, setting private
interests aside, I do not elevate too highly the character, tendencies, and aspirations
of the Brazilian people when I say that all their sympathies are on the side of
freedom and against slavery.
Yet the following truth must also be recognized: the reluctant attitude of the
government—the one force capable of destroying slavery—the still inconsequential
extent of its response to public opinion, and the slowness of the latter’s development
do not allow us to hope that the break between the government and slavery will
occur soon. If the abolitionist pressure did not exist, the government would delay
even more than it does. Consequently, our strength will grow as we are able to
arouse such opinion, as we call each class to action based upon its understanding
that slavery not only degrades our country but undermines it physically. The
instrument of success exists and is known to us; this instrument is power. The way to
produce power, which is also known to us, is through public concern. What remains
to be done is to endow that public opinion with the needed energy, to draw it out of
the lassitude which renders it useless, to prove to it that prolonged inactivity is
suicidal.
Compare the Brazil of today and its slavery with the ideal of a motherland which
we, the abolitionists, uphold. The latter is a country where all are free, where
European immigration, attracted by the openness of our institutions and by the
freedom of our system, will endlessly send to the tropics a current of lively,
energetic, and healthy Caucasian blood which we can absorb without danger,
instead of that Chinese wave with which the large landholders hope to contaminate
and corrupt our race even further. What we wish is a country which may work in
her own unique way for the good of humanity and the development of South
America.…
[The] past whose collapse we are now witnessing will give way to an order of
things founded upon an entirely different concept of our duties toward life,
property, the individual, the family, personal rights, honor, and individual integrity.
That past will make way for a society in which there is a new regard for our
fellowman, for the individual before the nation, for personal freedom, for
civilization, for equal legal protection, for established social achievements, for
humanity itself, which inspires us with the will to participate in this immense
heritage of our species, which in fact tacitly delivers this heritage over to the
protection of each one of us.
The abolitionists include all those who believe in a Brazil without slaves, all those
who anticipate the miracles of free labor, all those who suffer slavery as a detested
vassalage imposed upon the entire nation by some in the interests of some. They
include those who now gasp in the foul air which slaves and masters freely breathe

—those who do not believe that Brazil with slavery gone, will lie down to die, as did
the Roman in the age of the Caesars because he had lost his liberty.
This means that we are seeking our country’s highest interests, her civilization, the
future rightfully hers, the mission to which her place in America calls her. But,
between us and those who are blocking the path, who will win? This, indeed, is the
very enigma of Brazil’s national destiny. Slavery injected fanaticism into her
bloodstream, and she is now doing nothing to grasp control of her fate from those
blind and indifferent forces which now silently lead her on.
BRAZILIAN ABOLITION LAW NO. 3353, ABOLISHING SLAVERY IN BRAZIL, MAY 13, 1888

The Princess Imperial Regent, in the name of His Majesty the Emperor Dom Pedro II,
makes known to all subjects of the Empire that the General Assembly has decreed,
and she has sanctioned, the following law:
Art. 1. From the date of this law slavery is declared extinct in Brazil.
Art. 1. All provisions to the contrary are revoked.
She orders, therefore, all the authorities to whom the knowledge and execution of
this Law belong to carry it out, and cause it to be fully and exactly executed and
observed.
RUSSIAN PEASANTS AFTER EMANCIPATION: PEASANT PETITIONS
Discontent with the conditions of emancipation surfaced almost immediately in
Russia. For a time, petitions rained in. Over a longer period, major peasant protests
surged, in which remaining estates might be occupied and records of redemption
payments that peasants owed for the land they had received burned.
The petitions require some care in interpretation. They include detail that needs to
be sorted out to find the main points. They include some hyperbole, because the
peasants hoped to win the czar’s attention by elaborate expressions of trust and
obedience. What were the main grievances? How did peasants decide they could best
define the justice of their case?

PETITION FROM PEASANTS IN BALASHOV DISTRICT (SARATOV PROVINCE) TO GRAND DUKE KONSTANTIN
NIKOLAEVICH, 25 JANUARY 1862

Your Imperial Excellency! Most gracious sire! Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich!
Most magnanimous prince, given by God for the welfare of people in the Russian
Empire! The countless acts of mercy and humanitarianism of Your Imperial
Excellency toward the loyal subjects have emboldened us to fall to your feet and
plead:
Show your steadfast and just protection of oppressed humanity! Following the
example of our fathers, grandfathers and ancestors, we have always and without
complaint obeyed the laws of Russian monarchs and the authority of its rulers.…
The monarch’s mercy—which has no precedent in the chronicles of all peoples in
the universe—has now changed the attitude of our squire, who has reduced us 1,500
peasants to a pitiable condition.… After being informed of the Imperial manifesto
on the emancipation of peasants from serfdom in 1861 (which was explained to us
by the constable of township 2 of Balashov District), we received this [news] with
jubilation, as a special gift from heaven, and expressed our willingness to obey the

squire’s will in every respect during the coming two-year [transition] period [and to
remain] on the fertile land which we occupy, where we could realise our life.… [sic]
But from this moment, our squire ordered that the land be cut off from the entire
township. But this is absolutely intolerable for us: it not only denies us profit, but
threatens us with a catastrophic future. He began to hold repeated meetings and
[tried to] force us to sign that we agreed to accept the above land allotment. But,
upon seeing so unexpected a change, and bearing in mind the gracious manifesto,
we refused. … But when [the nobles] saw that this did not succeed, they had a
company of soldiers sent in and said that they had been sent—by the Tsar!—to
restore peace between us and the squires. … Then [Col.] Globbe came from their
midst, threatened us with exile to Siberia, and ordered the soldiers to strip the
peasants and to punish seven people by flogging in the most inhuman manner. They
still have not regained consciousness.
From Gregory L. Freeze, ed., From Supplication to Revolution: A Documentary
Social History of Imperial Russia (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), 171–
79. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.
The inhuman acts and intolerable oppression have forced us to fall to the sacred
feet of Your Imperial Excellency: 1,500 voices most humbly ask for just, most august
defense, which can save weeping families from certain death, and [we ask] that You
issue a decree [on our case].
PETITION FROM PEASANTS IN PODOSINOVKA (VORONEZH PROVINCE) TO ALEXANDER II, MAY 1863

The most merciful manifesto of Your Imperial Majesty from 19 February 1861, with
the published rules, put a limit to the enslavement of the people in blessed Russia.
But some former serfowners—who desire not to improve the peasants’ life, but to
oppress and ruin them—apportion land contrary to the laws, choose the best land
from all the fields for themselves, and give the poor peasants (who are just emerging
from their domination) the worst and least usable lands. … Of our fields and
resources, [our landlord] chose the best places from amidst our strips and, like a
cooking ring in a hearth, carved off 300 dessiatines for herself. Other places—
characterized by sand, hills, knolls and ravines (with the sparsest amount of
hayland)—were designated as the peasant allotment; altogether, including the
household plots, we were given four dessiatines per soul and assessed a quitrent of
12 rubles per soul. But our community refused to accept so ruinous an allotment and
requested that we be given an allotment in accordance with the local Statute [of
emancipation], without injury, even if the quitrent must be increased. … The
provincial governor—without making any investigation and without interrogating a
single person—ordered that the birch rods be brought and that the punishment
commence, which was carried out with cruelty and mercilessness. They punished up
to 200 men and women; 80 people were at four levels (with 500, 400, 300 and 200
blows); some received lesser punishment.…
Having explained the inhuman acts of our local authorities and our final
ruination through the oppressive allotment of unusable land in strips, we dare to
implore you, Orthodox emperor and our merciful father, not to reject the petition of
a community with 600 souls, including wives and children.…
AFRICAN AMERICANS AFTER SLAVERY: PETITIONS IN THE SOUTH
During the 1870s, former slaves often petitioned the federal government for new
opportunities, in a context in which Reconstruction state governments allowed them

voice. While most land remained in the hands of former plantation owners, blacks
managed to purchase some. They also set up schools and other community
institutions. But the end of Reconstruction showed how vulnerable the former slave
population was.
JOINT AFFIDAVIT FROM GEORGE UNDERWOOD, BEN HARRIS, AND ISIAH FULLER

Caddo Parish, La., August 3, 1875
We worked, or made a contract to work, and make a crop on shares on Mr.
McMoring’s place, and worked for one-third (⅓) of the crop, and he
(McMoring) was to find us all of our provisions; and in July, 1875, we was
working alone in the field, and Mr. McMoring and McBounton came to us
and says, “Well, boys, you all got to get away from here; and that they had
gone as far as they could go, and you all must live agreeable, or you shall
take what follows”; and the two white men went and got sticks and guns,
and told us that we must leave the place; and we told them that we would
not leave it, because we don’t want to give up our crop for nothing; and they
told us that we had better leave, or we would not get anything; and we
wanted to have justice, but he would not let us have justice; and we told
them that we would get judges to judge the crop, to say what it is worth;
and the white men told us that no judge should come on his place; and we
did not want to leave the place, but they beat Isiah Fuller, and whipped him,
and then we got afraid, and we left the place; and we got about thirty acres
in cotton, and the best cotton crop in that part of the parish; and we have
about twenty-nine acres of corn, and about the best corn in the parish, and it
is ripe, and the fodder ready to pull, and our cotton laid by; and runned us
off from the place, and told us not to come back any more; and we were due
McMoring the sum of one hundred and eighty dollars ($180) and they told
us that if they ever heard of it any more that they would fix us; and all the
time that we were living and working on the place they would not half feed
us; and we had to pay for all, or half of our rashings, or what we had to eat,
and that is all that was due them for; and we worked for them as though we
were slaves, and then treated like dogs all the time.
MEMORIAL FROM ALABAMA NEGROES

To His Excellency the President of the United States, and the honorable the Congress
of the United States:
The colored people of the State of Alabama, who by virtue of the three latest
amendments to the Constitution of the United States became emancipated, and also
became citizens of the United States, feeling anxiously and solemnly impressed by
their past and present condition in the State of Alabama, and by the grave and
menacing dangers that now surround and threaten them and their constitutional
rights, have as a race and as a people assembled together in convention to consider
their situation, and to take solemn counsel together as to what it becomes them to
do for their self-preservation.
From Herbert Aptheker, ed., A Documentary History of the Negro People in the
United States (New York: Citadel Press, 1951), 586, 600–603.
We, therefore, for your better information upon the subject, do humbly present
for your consideration and action the following memorial:
That as a race, and as citizens, we never have enjoyed, except partially,

imperfectly, and locally, our political and civil rights in this State. Our right to vote
in elections has been, in a large portion of this State, denied, abridged, and rendered
difficult and dangerous ever since we became voters. The means used by our
political opponents to destroy or impair their right have been various; but have
chiefly consisted of violence in the form of secret assassination, lynching,
intimidation, malicious and frivolous prosecutions and arrests, and by depriving or
threatening to deprive us of employment and the renting of lands, which many of us,
in our poverty and distress, were unable to disregard. These acts of lawlessness have
been repeated and continued since our first vote in 1868, and their effect has been
such that from ten to fifteen thousand of the votes of our race have in each election
been either repressed or been given under compulsion to our political opponents.…
Nor have we fared better in our civil rights of life, liberty, and property which
have come for adjudication before the State courts. It is true that republican judges
have generally presided over the superior courts of this State, and have generally
shown a disposition to do us justice, but even these have been to some extent,
warped by local pressure. But the main reasons for this failure of justice are that the
sheriffs, probate judges and clerks of courts have almost universally, throughout the
State, in plain violation of State laws, failed or refused to put men of our race on
grand and petit juries in most of the counties in Alabama, and it has followed, as a
consequence, that the lives, liberties, and property of black men have been decided
by grand and petit juries composed exclusively of white men who are their political
opponents. In controversies between our race and white men, and in criminal trials
where the accused or the injured is a black man, it is almost if not quite impossible
for a black man to obtain justice.… Our lives, liberties, and properties are made to
hang upon the capricious, perilous, and prejudiced judgments of juries composed of
a hostile community of ex-slaveholders who disdain to recognize the colored race as
their peers in anything, who look upon us as being by nature an inferior race, and by
right their chattel property.…
Pressed around with these wrongs, misfortunes, and dangers, and solemnly
impressed with their gravity, no resource or hope suggests itself to us but an earnest,
prayerful, and we hope not unavailing, appeal to the President and the Congress of
the United States, who still have the power and the agencies that may, in some
measure, right our wrongs and diminish our misfortunes.
The question which our case and condition presents to you is simply this: whether
our constitutional rights as citizens are to be a reality or a mockery, a protection
and a boon or a danger and a curse; whether we are to be freemen in fact or only in
name; and whether the late amendments to the Constitution are to be practically
enforced or to become a nullity and stand only “as dead letters on the statute-book.”

CHAPTER 25
RUSSIAN AND JAPANESE CONSERVATISM
Conservatism is not a standard world history topic. However, conservatism
experienced a number of crucial changes in the long nineteenth century, in a number
of different societies, while remaining a vigorous force, sometimes a dominant force,
in political life. The need to articulate reactions to change and foreign influence, and
the increasing ability to use nationalism to help shape conservative response, were
widespread developments that warrant explicit comparative treatment. Japanese and
Russian conservatisms were important in their own right, but they also raise larger
issues.
Conservatism is as old as human politics. Any political situation involves some
people a bit more eager for change and others insistent that current arrangements
should be preserved. These latter are conservatives. Some political cultures, because
of an emphasis on order, are more dominated by conservatism than others—China
before the twentieth century is an example frequently cited. But the general
phenomenon is a common one in history.
During the nineteenth century so many changes were occurring, because of new
political ideas (including ideas spread by the French Revolution), industrialization,
and imperialism, that conservatives in many areas were inclined to become more
explicit about their viewpoint and even to organize as a political movement. Formal
conservatism, as opposed to more informal groupings of like-minded leaders, thus
emerged in Europe during the French revolutionary era, around 1800. Further,
outside Europe, pressures to import political and social ideas and institutions from
the dynamic West prompted conservatives to worry about foreignness as well as
about change in general. Many conservatives found themselves defending against
Western corruption what they saw as vital elements of their own cultural and
political traditions.
Because political changes and Western influence were particularly widespread in
Japan from the Meiji era (beginning in 1868) onward and in Russia under Alexander
II (1855–81), conservatism in these two countries gained unusual importance and
complexity. Conservatives were forced to define what aspects of the contemporary
West and what resultant reform proposals were particularly objectionable. But they
might also identify certain ingredients that, altered to preserve national essentials,
could be accepted as change. In both countries conservatives wielded great
influence, shaping much of the reform process in Japan and, in Russia, preventing
certain kinds of reforms altogether.
Conservatism in the nineteenth century was rarely simple-minded. Many
conservatives recognized the need for some change: they merely insisted that many
older values and institutions should be essentially preserved and that change should
not be blindly embraced. Many Russian conservatives after 1861, for example,
clearly recognized that the emancipation of the serfs had been a desirable reform;
they did not argue for a return to serfdom, though they rarely wanted many more
concessions to the aggrieved peasantry. Russian conservatives also saw that their
country should participate in the kinds of scientific research being spearheaded in
Western Europe; there was danger in lagging behind here. Japanese conservatives
were even more flexible: they granted that the old system of feudalism and the

shogunate should not be restored (though they sometimes sought to maintain some
of the older values, including military honor). Conservatives in both countries
utilized the new force of nationalism. Interpreting modern conservatism as it began
to develop in response to the massive changes of the long nineteenth century thus
requires some subtlety: what did conservatives insist on keeping intact, and where
were they willing to bend?
Russian conservatives were in the ascendancy after Alexander II was assassinated
by terrorists in 1881. Although they did not oppose all change (industrialization
continued), they definitely resisted any further alterations to the political and social
structure. Their obstinacy helped develop an atmosphere of inflexibility and
repression that led to the revolutions of 1905 and 1907. Japanese conservatives
gained ground in the 1880s also, with the backing of the emperor, amid a
widespread sense that disorder was spreading, for example, in the schools.
Russian conservatism was not uniform, though all its leading spokesmen favored
nationalism, czarist autocracy, and the Orthodox church. Some conservative
nationalists praised the Russian people in the abstract while defining distinctive
views of the state and progress. Leaders such as Nikolai Danilevsky, in the 1860s,
bitterly opposed the West, but they could grant the need for some limited change.
After the terrorist assassination of czar Alexander II in 1881, however, Russian
conservatism became more defensive. Constantine Pobedonostsev became Russia’s
conservative leader. A lawyer, he gained positions both in the government and in the
Orthodox church, spurring reactionary policies between 1881 and 1905.
Pobedonostsev was outspoken in his hostility to key Western principles and
institutions.
In Japan, Yamagata Arimoto was the most conservative of the leading statesmen
of the Meiji era and was closely associated with the army. He, too, objected to many
Western values, but he also saw how certain Western practices, such as universal
military conscription, though radical in terms of Japanese tradition, could actually
benefit a conservative Japanese state. Here, he tried to show how history set a
Japanese precedent for a practice that was apparently new.
Comparing these two conservative currents requires the now-familiar balance
between noting the important points they have in common—do Russian and
Japanese leaders agree about Western political fallacies, for example?—and
discerning the ways in which they differ in degree of openness to limited change.
Questions
1. How did Danilevsky define Russian superiority? What, in his view, were Russia’s
key strengths?
2. What did Danilevsky mean by freedom? What recent reform was he willing to
defend? What few aspects of the West did he admire?
3. How do Danilevsky and Pobedonostsev compare as Russian nationalists and
conservatives? Did they agree on the qualities of a strong state? How do their
emphases differ?
4. Which version of Russian conservatism do Yamagata Arimoto’s views most
resemble: Danilevsky’s or Pobedonostsev’s?
5. Why and how did Russian conservatism change between the 1860s (Danilevsky,
and the 1880s (Pobedonostsev)?
6. What aspects of Western politics did Yamagata Arimoto, Danilevsky, and

Pobedonostsev all criticize? Did they agree in their reactions to the West?
7. How did Yamagata Arimoto and Pobedonostsev view voting and political parties
and the remedies for divisiveness?
8. How did Yamagata Arimoto’s Confucianism compare with Pobedonostsev’s
conservative ideals? Would Russian conservatives’ advice to soldiers be different
from Yamagata Arimoto’s? What are the implications of these differences? By
Russian conservative standards, is it accurate to call Yamagata Arimoto a
conservative at all?
9. What kinds of differences in national setting did the two conservative movements
suggest? In which country did conservatives have an easier time defending the
status quo in the 1880s and 1890s?
For Further Discussion
1. What is conservative nationalism? How does it differ from liberal or radical
nationalism?
2. Why did both Japanese and Russian conservatives emphasize the importance of an
emperor and a strong state?
3. What aspects of the West were most likely to be criticized by foreign observers in
the late nineteenth century? Are the same aspects still likely to be criticized today,
or has the list changed?
4. Can Japan’s greater success in combining change and stability be traced in the
nature of its conservatism? How did Russia’s version of conservatism play a role in
the conditions that led to major revolution?
DANILEVSKY
The following selection was authored by an ardent Slavic nationalist, Nikolai
Danilevsky, in a multiple-edition book called Russia and Europe, first issued in 1869.
Danilevsky asserts the special virtues of the Slavic peoples as against other
Europeans, and the dominance of Russia among the Slavs. Elements of his argument
might seem comical: he twists history, he glosses over ongoing problems such as
peasant discontent after emancipation, and he ludicrously promises stability in a
country almost foredoomed to revolution. But Danilevsky’s views about Russian
distinctiveness and Western evil were widely shared, even by people opposed to the
existing czarist regime. The complexities of his outlook were widely shared also, as
he talked about some selective borrowing from the West. Complexities of this sort
outlived the czarist regime and flourished after the Communist revolution of 1917.
•••
And now let us turn to the Slav world, and chiefly to Russia, its only independent
representative, in order to examine the results and the promises of this world, a
world still only at the beginning of its cultural-historical life. We must examine it
from the viewpoint of the above four foci of reference: religion, culture, politics, and
socioeconomic structure, in order to elucidate what we rightfully expect as well as
hope from the Slav cultural-historical type.
Religion constituted the most essential element of ancient Russian life, and at the
present time, the overwhelming spiritual interest of the ordinary Russian is also
involved in it; in truth, one cannot but wonder at the ignorance and the
impertinence of these people who could insist (to gratify their fantasies) on the
religious indifference of the Russian people.

From an objective, factual viewpoint, the Russian and the majority of Slav
peoples became, with the Greeks, the chief guardians of the living tradition of
religious truth, Orthodoxy, and in this way they continued the high calling, which
was the destiny of Israel and Byzantium: to be the chosen people.…
From Nikolai Danilevsky, Russia and Europe, in The Mind of Modern Russia, ed.
Hans Kohn (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1955), 200–211.
… The religious aspect of the cultural activity belongs to the Slav cultural type
and to Russia in particular; it is its inalienable achievement, founded on the
psychology of its people and on its guardianship of religious truth.…
Whatever the future may bring we are entitled, on the evidence of the past alone,
to consider the Slavs among the most gifted families of the human race in political
ability. Here we may turn our attention to the special character of this political
ability and show how it manifested itself during the growth of the Russian state. The
Russians do not send out colonists to create new political societies, as the Greeks did
in antiquity or the English in modern times. Russia does not have colonial
possessions, like Rome or like England. The Russian state from early Muscovite times
on has been Russia herself, gradually, irresistibly spreading on all sides, settling
neighboring non-settled territories, and assimilating into herself and into her
national boundaries foreign populations. This basic character of Russian expansion
was misunderstood because of the distortion of the original Russian point of view
through Europeanization, the origin of every evil in Russia.…
But the expansion of the state, its attainment of stability, strength, and power,
constitutes only one aspect of political activity. It has still another one, consisting of
the establishment of equal relationships between the citizens themselves and
between them and the state, i.e., in the establishment of civil and political freedom.
A people not endowed with this freedom cannot be said to possess a healthy
political sense. Is the Russian people capable of freedom?
Naturally our “well-wishers” give a negative answer: some regard slavery as a
natural element of the Russians, and others are afraid, or pretend to be afraid, that
freedom in Russian hands must lead to all sorts of excesses and abuses. But on the
basis of Russian history and with knowledge of the views and traits of the Russian
people, one can only form an opinion diametrically opposed to this view—namely,
that there hardly ever has existed or exists a people so capable of enduring such a
large share of freedom as the Russians and so little inclined to abuse it, due to their
ability and habit to obey, their respect and trust in the authorities, their lack of love
for power, and their loathing of interference in matters where they do not consider
themselves competent. If we look into the causes of all political troubles, we shall
find their root not in the striving after freedom, but in the love for power and the
vain cravings of human beings to interfere in affairs that are beyond their
comprehension.…
This nature of the Russian people is the true reason why Russia is the only state
which never had (and in all probability never will have) a political revolution, i.e., a
revolution having as its aim the limitation of the power of the ruler.…
With legality in the succession of the throne secured… and finally with the
liberation of the peasants, all the reasons which in former times had agitated the
people disappeared; and even an ordinary rebellion, going beyond the limits of a
regrettable misunderstanding, has become impossible in Russia so long as the moral
character of the Russian people does not change.…

… Thus we may conclude that the Russian people, by their attitude towards the
power of the state, by their ability to sacrifice to it their own personal interests, and
by their attitude towards the use of political and civil freedom, are gifted with
wonderful political sense.
In the socio-economic sphere, Russia is the only large state which has solid
ground under its feet, in which there are no landless masses, and in which,
consequently, the social edifice does not rest on the misery of the majority of the
citizens and on the insecurity of their situation. In Russia only there cannot and does
not exist any contradiction between political and economic ideals. … The factors
that give such superiority to the Russian social structure over the European, and give
it an un-shakable stability, are the peasant’s land and its common ownership. On this
health of Russia’s socio-economic structure we found our hope for the great socioeconomic significance of the Slav cultural-historical type. This type has been able for
the first time to create a just and normal system of human activity, which embraces
not only human relations in the moral and political sphere, but also man’s mastery
of nature, which is a means of satisfying human needs and requirements. Thus it
establishes not only formal equality in the relations between citizens, but a real and
concrete equality.
However, as regards the prominent place of the Slav cultural-historical type in the
field of culture proper, one must admit that so far the Russian and other Slav
achievements in the sciences and in the arts are insignificant in comparison with the
accomplishments of the two great cultural types, the Greek and the European.…
Scientific and artistic activity can thrive only under conditions of leisure, of an
overflow of forces that remain free from daily toil. Could much leisure be left over
among Russians and Slavs?… All these considerations fully answer, it seems to me,
the question why until now Russia and the other Slav countries could not occupy a
respected position in purely cultural activities. … But indications of these aptitudes,
of these spiritual forces, which are necessary for brilliant achievements in the fields
of science and art are now indisputably present among the Slav peoples in spite of
all the unfavorable conditions of their life; and, consequently, we are justified in
expecting that with a change in these conditions, these peoples will bring forth
remarkable creations.…
The Slav cultural type has already produced enough examples of artistic and, to a
lesser degree, scientific achievements to allow us to conclude that it has attained a
significant degree of development in these fields. The relative youth of the race and
the concentration of all its forces upon other, more urgent types of activity have not,
until now, given the Slavs the opportunity of acquiring cultural significance, in the
exact meaning of the phrase. This should not embarrass us; rather, it points to the
right path in our development. As long as there is no strong foundation, we cannot
and we must not think of the erection of a durable edifice; we can only set up
temporary buildings, which cannot be expected to display the talents of the builder
in every respect. The political independence of the race is the indispensable
foundation of culture, and consequently all the Slav forces must be directed towards
this goal. Independence is indispensable … [for] without the consciousness of Slav
racial unity, as distinct from other races, an independent culture is impossible.…
The requisite preliminary achievement of political independence has still another
importance in the cultural as well as in all other spheres: the struggle against the
Germano-Roman world (without which Slav independence is impossible) will help
to eradicate the cancer of imitativeness and the servile attitude towards the West,

which through unfavorable conditions has eaten its way into the Slav body and soul.
POBEDONOSTSEV
Constantine Pobedonostsev (1827–1907) was a statesman and jurist, trained in the
law. He tutored the future czar Alexander II, then served in the holy synod of the
Russian Orthodox Church (1880–1905), where he became the leading spokesman of
religious orthodoxy, nationalism, and autocracy. He had great influence over czar
Alexander III and encouraged policies of rigorous censorship, persecution of
religious minorities, and repression of all political opposition. He also supported an
activist foreign policy designed to enhance Russia’s national prestige. He wrote
widely on Russian law and also authored a number of attacks on Western
rationalism and liberalism.

What is this freedom by which so many minds are agitated, which inspires so many
insensate actions, so many wild speeches, which leads the people so often to
misfortune? In the democratic sense of the word, freedom is the right of political
power, or, to express it otherwise, the right to participate in the government of the
State. This universal aspiration for a share in the government has no constant
limitations, and seeks no definite issue, but incessantly extends. … Forever extending
its base, the new Democracy now aspires to universal suffrage—a fatal error, and
one of the most remarkable in the history of mankind. By this means, the political
power so passionately demanded by Democracy would be shattered into a number
of infinitesimal bits, of which each citizen acquires a single one. What will he do
with it, then? How will he employ it? In the result it has undoubtedly been shown
that in the attainment of this aim Democracy violates its sacred formula of
“Freedom indissolubly joined with Equality.” It is shown that this apparently equal
distribution of “freedom” among all involves the total destruction of equality. Each
vote, representing an inconsiderable fragment of power, by itself signifies nothing;
an aggregation of votes alone has a relative value. The result may be likened to the
general meetings of shareholders in public companies. By themselves individuals are
ineffective, but he who controls a number of these fragmentary forces is master of
all power, and directs all decisions and dispositions. We may well ask in what
consists the superiority of Democracy. Everywhere the strongest man becomes
master of the State; sometimes a fortunate and resolute general, sometimes a
monarch or administrator with knowledge, dexterity, a clear plan of action, and a
determined will; in a Democracy, the real rulers are the dexterous manipulators of
votes, with their place-men, the mechanics who so skillfully operate the hidden
springs which move the puppets in the arena of democratic elections. Men of this
kind are ever ready with loud speeches lauding equality; in reality, they rule the
people as any despot or military dictator might rule it.… Experience proves a very
different thing. The history of mankind bears witness that the most necessary and
fruitful reforms—the most durable measures—emanated from the supreme will of
statesmen, or from a minority enlightened by lofty ideas and deep knowledge, and
that, on the contrary, the extension of the representative principle is accompanied
by an abasement of political ideas and the vulgarization of opinions in the mass of
the electors.…
From Konstantin P. Pobyedonostsev, Reflections of a Russian Statesman, trans.
Robert Crozier Long (London: Grant Richard, 1898), 23–30, 32–46, 52–54, 62–74.
… Even in the classic countries of Parliamentarism [democracy] it would satisfy

not one of [its criteria]. The elections in no way express the will of the electors. The
popular representatives are in no way restricted by the opinions of their
constituents, but are guided by their own views and considerations, modified by the
tactics of their opponents. In reality, ministers are autocratic, and they rule, rather
than are ruled by Parliament. They attain power, and lose power, not by virtue of
the will of the people, but through immense influence… and they fear no censure
while they enjoy the support in Parliament of a majority which they maintain by the
distribution of bounties from the rich tables which the State has put at their
disposal. In reality, the ministers are as irresponsible as the representatives of the
people. Mistakes, abuse of power, and arbitrary acts, are of daily occurrence, yet
how often do we hear of the grave responsibility of a minister? It may be once in
fifty years a minister is tried for his crimes, with a result contemptible when
compared with the celebrity gained by the solemn procedure.…
… It is sad to think that even in Russia there are men who aspire to the
establishment of this falsehood among us; that our professors glorify to their young
pupils representative government as the ideal of political science; that our
newspapers pursue it…, under the name of justice and order, without troubling to
examine without prejudice the working of the parliamentary machine. Yet even
where centuries have sanctified its existence, faith already decays; the Liberal
intelligence exalts it, but the people groans under its despotism, and recognizes its
falsehood. We may not see, but our children and grandchildren assuredly will see,
the overthrow of this idol, which contemporary thought in its vanity continues still
to worship.…
The prevalent doctrine of the perfection of Democracy and of democratic
government stands on the same delusive foundation. This doctrine presupposes the
capacity of the people to understand subtleties of political science which have a
clear and substantial existence in the minds of its apostles only. Precision of
knowledge is attainable only by the few minds which constitute the aristocracy of
intellect; the mass, always and everywhere, is vulgus, and its conceptions of
necessity are vulgar.
Democracy is the most complicated and the most burdensome system of
government recorded in the history of humanity. For this reason it has never
appeared save as a transitory manifestation, with few exceptions giving place before
long to other systems. It is in no way surprising. The duty of the State is to act and
to ordain: its dispositions are manifestations of a single will; without this,
government is inconceivable. But how can a multitude of men, or a popular
assembly act with a single will?… Such conditions inevitably lead to anarchy, from
which society can be saved alone by dictatorship—that is, by the rehabilitation of
autocracy in the government of the world.
YAMAGATA ARIMOTO
Yamagata Arimoto (1838–1922) was born a samurai but backed the Meiji side in the
turmoil of 1860s. He studied military science in Europe and in the 1870s led in the
restructuring of the Japanese army, copying German organizational models. In the
1880s he concentrated more on domestic affairs, encouraging more Confucian
elements in the schools and repressing political opposition. He also supported
Japanese imperialism and a strong military influence in the government. Clearly
opposed to the more westernizing reformers in Japan, Yamagata Arimoto has been
the subject of some debate among historians of Japan, who argue about whether a

“conservative” label is really appropriate for this formative and dynamic leader in
modern Japanese history.

On Military Conscription, 1872
In the system in effect in our country in the ancient past everyone was a soldier. In
an emergency the emperor became the Marshal, mobilizing the able-bodied youth
for military service and thereby suppressing rebellion. When the campaign was over
the men returned to their homes and their occupations. … When the State suffers
disaster, the people cannot escape being affected. Thus, the people can ward off
disaster to themselves by striving to ward off disaster to the State. And where there
is a state, there is military defense; and if there is military defense there must be
military service. It follows, therefore, that the law providing for a militia is the law
of nature and not an accidental, man-made law. As for the system itself, it should be
made after a survey of the past and the present, and adapted to the time and
circumstance. The Occidental countries established their military systems after
several hundred years of study and experience. Thus, their regulations are exact and
detailed. However, the difference in geography rules out their wholesale adoption
here. We should now select only what is good in them, use them to supplement our
traditional military system, establish an army and a navy, require all males who
attain the age of twenty—irrespective of class—to register for military service, and
have them in readiness for all emergencies. Heads of communities and chiefs of
villages should keep this aim in mind and they should instruct the people so that
they will understand the fundamental principle of national defense.

Precepts for Soldiers and Sailors, 1882
1. The soldier and sailor should consider loyalty their essential duty. Who that is
born in this land can be wanting in the spirit of grateful service to it? No soldier or
sailor, especially, can be considered efficient unless this spirit be strong within him.
A soldier or a sailor in whom this spirit is not strong, however skilled in art or
proficient in science, is a mere puppet; and a body of soldiers or sailors wanting in
loyalty, however well ordered and disciplined it may be, is in an emergency no
better than a rabble. Remember that, as the protection of the state and the
maintenance of its power depend upon the strength of its arms, the growth or
decline of this strength must affect the nation’s destiny for good or for evil; therefore
neither be led astray by current opinions nor meddle in politics, but with single
heart fulfil your essential duty of loyalty, and bear in mind that duty is weightier
than a mountain, while death is lighter than a feather. Never by failing in moral
principle fall into disgrace and bring dishonor upon your name.
[The second article concerns the respect due to superiors and consideration to be
shown inferiors. The third urges bravery and a sense of duty.]
4. The soldier and the sailor should highly value faithfulness and righteousness.…
Faithfulness implies the keeping of one’s word, and righteousness the fulfilment of
one’s duty. If then you wish to be faithful and righteous in any thing, you must
carefully consider at the outset whether you can accomplish it or not. If you
thoughtlessly agree to do something that is vague in its nature and bind yourself to

unwise obligations, and then try to prove yourself faithful and righteous, you may
find yourself in great straits from which there is no escape. … Ever since ancient
times there have been repeated instances of great men and heroes who,
overwhelmed by misfortune, have perished and left a tarnished name to posterity,
simply because in their effort to be faithful in small matters they failed to discern
right and wrong with reference to fundamental principles, or because, losing sight of
the true path of public duty, they kept faith in private relations. You should, then,
take serious warning by these examples.
5. The soldier and sailor should make simplicity their aim. If you do not make
simplicity your aim, you will become effeminate and frivolous and acquire fondness
for luxurious and extravagant ways; you will finally grow selfish and sordid and sink
to the last degree of baseness, so that neither loyalty nor valor will avail to save you
from the contempt of the world.
On Local Government, 1890
… According to what I have heard, discord between political parties has gradually
extended into every aspect of community life. Hardly a person in social, business,
and economic relations, and in education, has remained untouched by this situation.
… There are some people who abandon what they should be doing and expend both
time and effort in unproductive political debate, and some who, losing their sense of
purpose, even run afoul of the law. These evils are spreading their influence,
morally, economically, and politically, throughout the country. They will impair the
people’s happiness and exert a harmful effect on the prosperity of the nation. In
general, if a new government, in the course of its establishment, is abused for
reasons of personal interests, the results could be extremely harmful. They could
affect the strength and the cohesion of the entire people and become the cause of
the decline of the nation. The history of our country and that of other countries
provides many such examples in every age. The people, if they wish to prevent the
growth of such evil influences, must regard at all times the unified endeavor of all as
their highest aim. And the responsibility of those in a position to guide the people
must be to apply themselves as administrators of the government to this ideal.
His Majesty the Emperor has granted the constitutional system to his ministers
and subjects for the purpose of elevating their morals and of promoting their
happiness. By virtue of this constitution ministers and subjects have been enabled to
gain a higher degree of freedom and to improve their lot in life so that they can
stand on an equal footing with peoples of other civilized nations. But if,
unfortunately, we should err—however little—in putting this constitutional system
into operation, we the people will have lost our position of honor. And thus, today,
the duty of a loyal subject is to cultivate true constitutional liberty and to enjoy its
benefits in peace.
If men lack self-respect and self-restraint, there cannot be freedom in its true
sense. One who respects himself will of necessity respect others. One who wishes
others to respect his own opinions must respect the views of others. There is no logic
in the position that only one’s own opinions are correct. Irrespective of place,
diverse opinions are inevitable when the interests of people are not the same. Thus,
we must make every effort to tolerate the views of others and to resolve differences
mutually. If this is not done contention will not cease. The constitutional system is
an instrument for the adjustment of diverse views: the use of force and violence will
not only fail to eradicate differences in viewpoints but will also aggravate them.

Political problems do not encompass the entire field of human interests. The
people who might entertain different political views very frequently hold mutually
identical views in religious and moral matters, and in matters of personal and social
relations. It is not the way of a loyal, trustworthy man to set aside his religious,
moral, personal, and social relationships in the sole interest of politics. Thus, to
promote party rivalry to extremes is a human misfortune. Nay, to resort to violence
and to use obstructionist methods against an opponent to promote one’s political
position is to permit personal passions to enslave him. It is against the principle of
the observance of the law. It is against the spirit of the constitutional system.
It is especially undesirable that one abandon his occupational pursuit for the sake
of a political cause. It is against his own interest as well as that of society as a
whole. The economic strength of a country is dependent mainly on productive labor.
Thus, it is not the way of the good citizen to indulge in needless arguments to the
neglect of his calling. Not only will he thus fail to add his bit to the national wealth
but he will also fail to induce others to develop industrious habits of self-reliance.
On Political Parties, 1917 (Repeating an 1898 Essay)
The parties seem smugly unconcerned over the danger to our country of having to
stand alone and without support in the future among the powers of the world. The
evils of partisan politics are indeed deplorable. If this trend is permitted to develop
unchecked, I fear that the spirit of the Meiji Restoration will die and the splendid
achievements of the late emperor will soon come to naught. The actual situation
with respect to political parties in our country today indicates that when one party
is excessively strong in Parliament, that party becomes reckless and arbitrary. When
two parties are evenly matched, the struggle between them becomes extremely
violent. Thus, to eliminate arbitrary actions and violent political struggles, it would
seem advisable to divide their strength and to have them restrain each other
mutually. I have faith in a plan to establish a three-party system in the Diet which
would eliminate excesses and help foster moderation. If the third party is organized
by men who are impartial and moderate, and possessed of intelligence and a sincere
concern for the well-being of the country, it is my belief that it can make a
contribution to the state toward the achievement of constitutional government, and
it will set an example to others. … We must organize a group consisting of fair and
intelligent men who will stand between the two existing parties and be partial to
neither; who can check party excesses and irregularities; who can restrain the
ambitions of those who seek to satisfy their avarice or their desire for political
power through the instrument of the party; who can transcend the common run of
politicians for whom politics is a means of livelihood; and who can go forward,
resolutely and firmly, with but the one thought in mind of service to the state. Only
by the conduct of a central core of such men who would not be corrupted by
thoughts of personal gain or fame, and only by having as a nucleus in the Diet men
who would not falter in their public devotion, can the secret of true constitutional
government be achieved.
The greater the number of such representatives we can gather, the better it will
be. However, the number of such men, both economically established and
patriotically inclined, need not be numerous. … There must be several million
among our population of seventy million who have fixed property and are
economically secure, and who therefore are above corruption. If such men come
forward to organize a solid nucleus in the Diet, the empire will be on a firm and
secure foundation, and there need be no anxiety in the country.…

CHAPTER 26
BUSINESS VALUES IN THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
Western Europe and Japan
This chapter explores the similarities and differences between the ideas and
motivations of businessmen in two of the key industrial areas of the long nineteenth
century: Western Europe and Japan.
Comparing business values in Japan and Western Europe offers two angles, both
central to world history from the nineteenth century onward. First is the question of
what kind of business culture links to successful industrialization; the West displayed
a highly functional set of business values, but so ultimately did Japan in a somewhat
different fashion. Comparison helps expand our understanding of the two industrial
approaches and, potentially, sets a basis for considering industrial cultures more
generally. The second point involves what by the later twentieth century was being
referred to as the development of a global middle class, as part of the globalization
process more generally. For Japan, the later nineteenth century was the time when
the key adjustments to globalization occurred. Comparing Japan and the West offers
suggestions about the expansion of middle-class values ultimately on a global scale.
The industrial revolution was one of the fundamental developments of modern
world history, introducing powerful new technology to most branches of production,
transportation, and communication, while propelling manufacturing ahead of
agriculture as a source of jobs and wealth.
Amid all the facets of industrialization, the role of the business community was a
crucial ingredient and an important result. Industrialization everywhere depended
on business initiatives in the nineteenth century, but it also depended on new
business attitudes. More traditional merchants, in places like Western Europe and
Japan, did not welcome the innovations that came with industrialization. They
found industrial technology messy and industrial investment too risky. They viewed
industrial entrepreneurs as grubby upstarts—at least until success brought great
wealth.
Yet there were new values and motivations available. In Western Europe, the
Enlightenment helped provide a new belief in the value of work and the validity of
increasing wealth. The same ideas of progress that could inspire political or
scientific revolution could justify new economic initiatives. In some cases,
Enlightenment ideals combined with religious interests to produce businessmen
eager to demonstrate God’s grace through economic success.
By the early nineteenth century many spokespeople proclaimed the virtues of
social mobility and the acquisition of wealth. Self-help manuals urged hard work,
thrift, and daring as the keys to legitimate business success. And businessmen
themselves periodically wrote tracts or memoirs extolling similar values, which they
viewed as fundamental to their own success and the good of society at large.
The new attributes associated with business innovation could be challenging to
many societies outside the West. Japan was a case in point, after the Meiji era began
under western pressure in 1868. Though Japan had a substantial merchant tradition,
there were fewer preindustrial businessmen and less business wealth than had
existed in the West. Japan had not experienced the scientific revolution or the
Enlightenment. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the hold of

Confucianism had increased.
In this setting Japan developed a complex combination of imitation and
adaptation, which would allow industrial development to mesh with established
values. Businessmen and Confucian leaders alike wrestled with the problems of
defining appropriate goals, and on the whole outright westernization was rejected.
Government played a greater direct role in Japan’s industrialization than had been
the case in countries like Britain and France. A Ministry of Industry, set up in 1881,
sponsored technological innovation, directly subsidized individual business leaders,
and ran many operations in heavy industry directly. But Japan did experience a
surge of new business leadership and social mobility. Talented former peasants
generated most factory operations in textiles. A large middle-class sector developed
around them.
Comparison with the West contributes to our understanding of why Japan was
poised for rapid economic change, why it could create its own version of an
energetic business class. Western and Japanese business sectors continue to interact
and to differ. Distinctive approaches to middle-class goals, emerging in the early
industrial periods, continue to matter in the two leading regions of industrialization
today.
The following selections are from the writings of a British publicist and a
Japanese reformer and from the accounts of actual industrialists in France and
Japan.
Questions
1. What did Samuel Smiles mean by self-help? How did he compare the roles of
business and of education in preparing the individual? What attitudes did he imply
toward workers who did not manage to rise?
2. What, according to Smiles, were the rewards for work?
3. Did Narcisse Faucheur—a businessman, not a writer—show the same values that
Smiles preached so widely? What were his main motivations? How did he define
success? What kinds of attitudes toward his workers and toward society at large
did Faucheur seem to have?
4. What is the nature of the individualism preached and practiced by members of the
Western middle class in the nineteenth century?
5. How did Fukuzawa define and defend individualism? How did Shibuzawa’s goals
differ from Fukuzawa’s prescriptions?
6. How did Confucianism affect definitions of business entrepreneurship in latenineteenth-century Japan?
7. How did nationalism help justify business in Meiji Japan? Did early Western
industrialists invoke nationalism in the same way? What might account for
differences here?
8. How did Faucheur and Shibuzawa describe their own work values?
9. How would Faucheur react to Shibuzawa’s statement of motives? How would
Shibuzawa critique Smiles’s basic approach to success?
10. What were the most important similarities between the roles and ideas of
Japanese and Western business leaders?
For Further Discussion

1. How could two different sets of business values work equally well in undergirding industrialization and the rise of a new middle class?
2. How might Western and Japanese middle-class values lead to different attitudes
toward the role of government in industry? How might they lead to different
attitudes toward workers and worker organizations? Would the attitudes produce
different reactions to aggressive worker unions and strikes—and which business
group would resist protest more fiercely?
3. Were Japanese business values and political conservatism (chapter 23) opposed to
each other, or did they blend together in creating a distinctive approach to
modern society?
4. Did Western and Japanese business styles relate at all to earlier definitions of
feudalism, in which the two regions had also overlapped and yet diverged (see
chapter 8)?
5. How do different traditions of business goals continue to distinguish Japanese
economic organization and behavior from their Western counterparts? Why do
some Western leaders argue that certain Japanese emphases should now be
imitated elsewhere?
BUSINESS IDEALS IN BRITAIN: SAMUEL SMILES
Samuel Smiles was the leading spokesperson for middle-class values of work and
mobility in mid-nineteenth-century Britain. A small-town doctor, Smiles early turned
to writing as his main source of income. His books, notably the classic Self-Help
(first published in 1859), went through many editions, until interest in this up-bythe-bootstraps approach declined as business organization became more complex
after 1870. Many artisans and shopkeepers read Smiles, seeking clues that would
improve their own fortune. We cannot know how many people agreed with Smiles’s
preachments, but the evidence suggests widespread interest. Interpreting Smiles and
the many similar authors throughout the early industrial West is not a totally
straightforward task, for though the value system was not complex, it was new, a
departure from more traditional Western social measurements.
•••
The spirit of self-help, as exhibited in the energetic action of individuals, has in all
times been a marked feature in the English character, and furnishes the true measure
of our power as a nation. Rising above the heads of the mass there were always to
be found a series of individuals distinguished beyond others, who commanded the
public homage. But our progress has also been owing to multitudes of smaller and
less known men. Though only the generals’ names may be remembered in the history
of any great campaign, it has been in a great measure through the individual valour
and heroism of the privates that victories have been won. … Even the humblest
person, who sets before his fellows an example of industry, sobriety, and upright
honesty of purpose in life, has a present as well as a future influence upon the wellbeing of his country; for his life and character pass unconsciously into the lives of
others, and propagate good example for all time to come.
Daily experience shows that it is energetic individualism which produces the most
powerful effects upon the life and action of others, and really constitutes the best
practical education. Schools, academies, and colleges, give but the merest beginnings
of culture in comparison with it. Far more influential is the life-education daily
given in our homes, in the streets, behind counters, in workshops, at the loom and

the plough, in counting-houses and manufactories, and in the busy haunts of men.
This is that finishing instruction as members of society, …—all that tends to
discipline a man truly, and fit him for the proper performance of the duties and
business of life,—a kind of education not to be learnt from books, or acquired by
any amount of mere literary training.…
From Samuel Smiles, Self-Help (London, 1859), 38–39, 47–48, 115–19, 281–84.
The instances of men, in this and other countries, who, by dint of persevering
application and energy, have raised themselves from the humblest ranks of industry
to eminent positions of usefulness and influence in society, are indeed so numerous
that they have long ceased to be regarded as exceptional. Looking at some of the
more remarkable, it might almost be said that early encounter with difficulty and
adverse circumstances was the necessary and indispensable condition of success.…
[Many of our leaders are partly proud] to think that a person risen from that
condition [of child labor in the factories] should be able to sit side by side, on equal
terms, with the hereditary gentry of the land.…
Fortune has often been blamed for her blindness; but fortune is not so blind as men
are. Those who look into practical life will find that fortune is usually on the side of
the industrious, as the winds and waves are on the side of the best navigators. In the
pursuit of even the highest branches of human inquiry the commoner qualities are
found the most useful—such as common sense, attention, application, and
perseverance. Genius may not be necessary, though even genius of the highest sort
does not disdain the use of these ordinary qualities. The very greatest men have been
among the least believers in the power of genius, and as worldly wise and
persevering as successful men of the commoner sort. Some have even defined genius
to be only common sense intensified… owing their success in a great measure, to
their indefatigable industry and application.…
Hence, a great point to be aimed at is to get the working quality well trained.
When that is done, the race will be found comparatively easy. We must repeat and
again repeat; facility will come with labour. Not even the simplest art can be
accomplished without it; and what difficulties it is found capable of achieving: It
was by early discipline and repetition that the late Sir Robert Peel [British politician,
son of a businessman] cultivated those remarkable, though still mediocre powers,
which rendered him so illustrious an ornament of the British Senate. When a boy at
Drayton Manor, his father was accustomed to set him up at table to practise
speaking ex tempore; and he early accustomed him to repeat as much of the
Sunday’s sermon as he could remember. Little progress was made at first, but by
steady perseverance the habit of attention became powerful, and the sermon was at
length repeated almost verbatim. When afterwards replying in succession to the
arguments of his parliamentary opponents—an art in which he was perhaps
unrivalled—it was little surmised that the extraordinary power of accurate
remembrance which he displayed on such occasions had been originally trained
under the discipline of his father in the parish church of Drayton.
It is indeed marvellous what continuous application will effect in the commonest
of things.…
To wait patiently, however, men must work cheerfully. Cheerfulness is an
excellent working quality, imparting great elasticity to the character. As a bishop
has said, ‘Temper is nine-tenths of Christianity’; so are cheerfulness and diligence
nine-tenths of practical wisdom. They are the life and soul of success, as well as of
happiness: perhaps the very highest pleasure in life consisting in clear, brisk,

conscious working; energy, confidence, and every other good quality mainly
depending upon it.…
How a man uses money—makes it, saves it, and spends it—is perhaps one of the best
tests of practical wisdom. Although money ought by no means to be regarded as a
chief end of man’s life, neither is it a trifling matter, to be held in philosophic
contempt, representing as it does to so large an extent the means of physical comfort
and social well-being. Indeed, some of the finest qualities of human nature are
intimately related to the right use of money; such as generosity, honesty, justice, and
self-sacrifice; as well as the practical virtues of economy and providence. On the
other hand, there are their counterparts of avarice, fraud, injustice, and selfishness,
as displayed by the inordinate lovers of gain; and the vices of thriftlessness,
extravagance, and improvidence, on the part of those who misuse and abuse the
means entrusted to them.…
Comfort in worldly circumstances is a condition which every man is justified in
striving to attain by all worthy means. … The very effort required to be made to
succeed in life with this object is of itself an education; stimulating a man’s sense of
self-respect, bringing out his practical qualities, and disciplining him in the exercise
of patience, perseverance, and such like virtues. The provident and careful man must
necessarily be a thoughtful man, for he lives not merely in the present, but with
provident forecast makes arrangements for the future. He must also be a temperate
man, and exercise the virtue of self-denial, than which nothing is so much calculated
to give strength to the character.…
Hence the lesson of self-denial—the sacrificing of a present gratification for a
future good—is one of the last that is learnt. Those classes which work the hardest
might naturally be expected to value the most the money which they earn. Yet the
readiness with which so many are accustomed to eat up and drink up their earnings
as they go renders them to a great extent helpless and dependent upon the frugal.
There are large numbers of persons among us who, though enjoying sufficient means
of comfort and independence, are often found to be barely a day’s march ahead of
actual want when a time of pressure occurs; and hence a great cause of social
helplessness and suffering.…
… That there should be a class of men who live by their daily labour in every
state is the ordinance of God, and doubtless is a wise and righteous one; but that this
class should be otherwise than frugal, contented, intelligent, and happy is not the
design of Providence, but springs solely from the weakness, self-indulgence, and
perverseness of man himself. The healthy spirit of self-help created amongst working
people would more than any other measure serve to raise them as a class, and this,
not by pulling down others, but by levelling them up to a higher and still advancing
standard of religion, intelligence, and virtue.
A F RENCH BUSINESSMAN: NARCISSE FAUCHEUR
Narcisse Faucheur set up a textile factory from the 1820s onward, the early decades
of French industrialization. He was not an industrial giant but a fairly average
industrialist—the sort that really helped industrial firms to spread after someone else
took a lead. Faucheur notes his dependence on British technological innovations, for
example, which he simply imported. He was from a rather traditional small
merchant family, whose habits he both utilized and transcended as he moved into
the modern business context. He wrote an autobiography reviewing his career,
printed in the 1880s in a limited edition for his children and grandchildren. His

discussion of his activities and his self-elevation provide solid clues about his basic
ideas and motivations, though he never spells these matters out directly.
•••
… The idea of leaving for America again struck my fancy, but my parents were
absolutely opposed to it. I yielded to their wishes rather than cause them the least
unhappiness.… Finally, after a long and very arduous search, our friend announced
that he had found a position for me with the most important wholesalers in
Clermont.…
The friend whom I mentioned in the last chapter had found an opening for me in
the firm of M. Cassan-Guyot, who was a wholesale dealer in [cloth] products.… This
firm was, without doubt, the most important in Clermont. Unfortunately, I received
a very meager salary, and because I was living with my parents I gave my mother all
my earnings to help with the household expenses, which had risen sharply upon my
arrival. I had rather quickly observed how poor my unfortunate parents were, so it
was with real joy that at the end of each month I placed into my mother’s hands the
paltry sum I had earned.…
I soon saw, therefore, that it would be necessary for me to find another source of
income in order to maintain a modest but always neat and proper wardrobe.…
When I became a travelling salesman for M. Delcros, I had the opportunity to talk
with many other merchants and salesmen in Lille. They spoke of it as a city with a
great commercial future and as an area full of opportunities for a young man such
as I to establish himself by his own efforts. I was taken with the idea because I was
already preoccupied with plans for the future. I wrote to my brother about it, and he
encouraged me to transfer to Lille, not only because we would have the pleasure of
seeing each other often, but also because it would be a step toward the realization of
my goals.

Although I was well liked by my employer, the firm offered me no prospects of a
partnership. It didn’t have enough capital to expand its operations to the point that I
might one day acquire a financial interest in it. I was condemned, therefore, to grow
old as a salesman and to devote all my energies to [working for] other people.…
My lace business prospered for several years, but gradually a new product began to
hurt it. I am speaking of tulle, which replaced lace and was much cheaper. The
designs on the tulle, all of which was imported, were nearly all in very bad taste. I
thought that if I embroidered on the tulle some attractive French designs, I could sell
it easily and make a large profit.
I went to England to learn about this industry and to see if I could bring it into
France. I took from England all the information I needed, but I decided against
buying the looms used to make plain tulle, for they were too expensive and their
purchase would have used funds which I needed in my other commercial ventures.
Therefore, I concentrated on information dealing with embroidering tulle, an
operation I hoped to start in France. I returned to Lille with some detailed designs
and some patterns by which one could determine the number of stitches each design
required. Since tulle embroidery work was paid according to the number of stitches
in a design, these patterns made it easy for me to determine labor costs and set the

final price.
In Saint-Armand I was in contact with two old spinsters who had two very
intelligent nieces. The nieces were very good embroiderers but they didn’t know how
to work with tulle. I showed these ladies some samples of this embroidery and they
assured me that if a woman skilled in the technique would give them some lessons,
they could easily learn to do it themselves. They also claimed that they would be
able to train many other young girls in Saint-Armand to be embroiderers, since there
was no other occupation open to them in the region, no matter what their social
class. We agreed that if I put my plan into practice my workshop would be in the
home of the aunts, who would then be directors, and that the nieces would be
foremen, all of them earning a reasonable salary.
When I was sure of being able to establish an embroidery workshop at SaintArmand on advantageous terms, I left for Paris, where I had a good designer make a
number of attractive patterns. I next arranged for an English woman from
Nottingham who was very skilled in embroidery work to teach the two nieces of the
ladies Dutordoir.…
From the start everything succeeded according to my wishes. In a short time I had
a factory of more than three hundred embroiderers in the Dutordoir home. The first
pieces I put up for sale gave me a profit all the more considerable since labor costs
were very low.…
In every way possible I tried to speed up production. I was involved with every
detail, for the newness of the designs determined their merit and price. But I was
unable to rush production as much as I hoped and the scale of my business remained
limited.…
… [My sales] trips varied from twenty-five to forty days. … But an ordinary
salesman would have certainly doubled the time, for he would not have wanted to
subject himself to all the strain that I endured. For several years I had to make two
or three of these whirlwind trips, and God knows all the difficulty that they stirred
up for me, no matter how necessary they were!
My yearly profits did not reflect all the work I put in, but over the long run my
fortune grew slowly. The market was such that one had to make his decisions with
courage. The competition was intense, the profits small, and one could lose all his
customers if he set his prices higher than his competitors.…
In the preceding chapters I have told you of the hard work to which your mother
and I diligently devoted ourselves to make our business prosper. It is now time to
describe for you the order and thrift which guided our expenditures. Since our
annual profits were not very large, our budget had to be rigorously kept within our
income if our savings were to increase little by little.…
PRAISING INDIVIDUALISM: FUKUZAWA YUKICHI
The following two passages were written by a tireless Meiji westernizer. Fukuzawa
(1834–1901) visited the United States and Western Europe early, in 1860. Proud of
Japan and sometimes capable of defending Confucianism when he was too hardpressed by more conservative figures (see chapter 23), Fukuzawa on the whole stood
for change in a Western direction. Much of his work was devoted to educational
reform, where he urged a more individualistic approach, but he also wrote on
business topics directly. His views helped stimulate debate among businessmen, most
of whom sought to reintroduce a more Confucian element—as the next selection

suggests.
•••
ON EDUCATION

In my interpretation of education, I try to be guided by the laws of nature and I try
to co-ordinate all the physical actions of human beings by the very simple laws of
“number and reason.” In spiritual or moral training, I regard the human being as the
most sacred and responsible of all orders, unable in reason to do anything base.
Therefore, in self-respect, a man cannot change his sense of humanity, his justice, his
loyalty or anything belonging to his manhood even when driven by circumstances to
do so. In short, my creed is that a man should find his faith in independence and
self-respect.
From Eichi Kiyooka, trans., The Autobiography of Yukichi Fukuzawa (New York:
Columbia University Press, 1980), 44–47. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.
From my own observations in both Occidental and Oriental civilizations, I find
that each has certain strong points and weak points bound up in its moral teachings
and scientific theories. But when I compare the two in a general way as to wealth,
armament, and the greatest happiness for the greatest number, I have to put the
Orient below the Occident. Granted that a nation’s destiny depends upon the
education of its people, there must be some fundamental differences in the
education of Western and Eastern peoples.
In the education of the East, so often saturated with Confucian teaching, I find
two things lacking; that is to say, a lack of studies in number and reason in material
culture, and a lack of the idea of independence in spiritual culture. But in the West I
think I see why their statesmen are successful in managing their national affairs, and
the businessmen in theirs, and the people generally ardent in their patriotism and
happy in their family circles.
I regret that in our country I have to acknowledge that people are not formed on
these two principles, though I believe no one can escape the laws of number and
reason, nor can anyone depend on anything but the doctrine of independence as
long as nations are to exist and mankind is to thrive. Japan could not assert herself
among the great nations of the world without full recognition and practice of these
two principles. And I reasoned that Chinese philosophy as the root of education was
responsible for our obvious shortcomings.
With this as the fundamental theory of education, I began and, though it was
impossible to institute specialized courses because of lack of funds, I did what I
could in organizing the instructions on the principles of number and reason. And I
took every opportunity in public speech, in writing, and in casual conversations, to
advocate my doctrine of independence. Also I tried in many ways to demonstrate
the theory in my actual life. During my endeavor I came to believe less than ever in
the old Chinese teachings.
ON BUSINESS

In the primitive, uncivilized world men could not benefit themselves without
injuring others; therefore those who were active in mind and body and accomplished
things were always thieves. This is not so in the civilized world; those who gain
riches and fame always benefit others by doing so.…
Everyone in the country individually aims at increasing his own private wealth. …

Desiring more and still more, they utilize all their secret skills in the competition for
new things, and in this way new methods are evolved, land is reclaimed and
developed, machines are invented, transportation and communications are
improved, and the investment of capital is effected.… Private zeal is the source of
national wealth.
A JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN’S VIEWS: SHIBUZAWA EIICHI
The following selections were written by a leading businessman of the Japanese
reform (Meiji) era, as industrialization was getting under way. Shibuzawa Eiichi
(1840–1931) ultimately presided over a hundred companies, after a period of
service in government. He was from a prosperous peasant family. As an industrialist
he concentrated particularly on factory textile production. He also participated
actively in the growing debate over Western values as they applied to economic life.
•••
FROM THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY

The business world around 1873, the year when I resigned my post at the Ministry of
Finance, was one filled with inertia. That condition is hard to imagine from the
standards we hold for the business world today [1927, when Shibuzawa dictated this
autobiography]. There was a tradition of respecting officials and despising common
people. All talented men looked to government services as the ultimate goal in their
lives, and ordinary students followed the examples set by them. There was
practically no one who was interested in business. When people met, they discussed
only matters relating to the affairs of state and of the world. There was no such
thing as practical business education.
It was said that the Meiji Restoration was to bring about equality among the four
classes of people. In practice, however, those who engaged in commerce and
industry were regarded as plain townspeople as before, and were despised and had
to remain subservient to government officials. I knew conditions such as this should
not be allowed to persist. A rigid class structure should not be tolerated. We should
be able to treat each other with respect and make no differentiation between
government officials and townspeople. This was essential to our national welfare, as
we looked forward to strengthening the country which required wealth to back it up.
We needed commerce and industry to attain the goal of becoming a rich nation.
Unworthy as I was, I thought of engaging in commerce and industry to help promote
the prosperity of our nation. I might not have talent to become a good politician,
but I was confident that I could make a difference in the fields of commerce and
industry.…

As to the question of development of commerce and industry, I felt that to engage
in an individually managed shop would be going against the tide of the times, and it
was necessary for small business firms to join their forces together. In other words,
they have to incorporate, and I decided to devote my energy to this endeavor. As to
the laws governing incorporation, I thought about them while studying in France.

After my return from France and before my entering into government service, I
organized a chamber of commerce in Shizuoka to serve as a model for incorporation
in this country. Since that time, I have consistently advocated the advantages of
incorporation.
In organizing a company, the most important factor one ought to consider is to
obtain the services of the right person to oversee its operation. In the early years of
Meiji, the government also encouraged incorporation of companies and organized
commercial firms and development companies. The government actively
participated in these companies’ affairs and saw to it that their various needs were
met fully. However, most of these companies failed because their management was
poor. To state it simply, the government failed to have the right men as their
managers. I had no experience in commerce and industry, but I also prided myself
on the fact that I had greater potential for success in these fields than most of the
nongovernmental people at that time.
I also felt that it was necessary to raise the social standing of those who engaged
in commerce and industry. By way of setting an example, I began studying and
practicing the teachings of the Analects of Confucius. It contains teachings first
enunciated more than twenty-four hundred years ago. Yet it supplies the ultimate in
practical ethics for all of us to follow in our daily living. It has many golden rules
for businessmen. For example, there is a saying: “Wealth and respect are what men
desire, but unless a right way is followed, they cannot be obtained; poverty and
lowly position are what men despise, but unless a right way is found, one cannot
leave that status once reaching it.” It shows very clearly how a businessman must act
in this world. Thus, when I entered the business world, I engaged in commerce and
industry in a way consistent with the teachings of the Analects and practiced the
doctrine of unity of knowledge and action.

FROM “MY VIEW OF LIFE”

There are in the final analysis only two types: i.e., those who consider the existence
of self objectively and those who consider it subjectively. The objective view regards
society first and the self second. The ego is disregarded to the point where one
sacrifices the self for the sake of society without hesitation. The subjective view, on
the other hand, is selfishly aware of the existence of the ego in all situations and
recognizes the existence of society only secondarily. To this extent it is willing even
to sacrifice society for the sake of the self.…
We would end in a situation in which the appetites could only be satisfied by men
looting from one another. If the human heart comes to that, then the ultimate result
would be such indecent behavior as forgetting our benefactors, turning our backs on
our friends, and abandoning our loved ones.…
FROM “INDEPENDENCE AND SELF-RELIANCE”

One must beware of the tendency of some to argue that it is through individualism
or egoism [jiko hon’i] that the State and society can progress most rapidly. They
claim that under individualism, each individual competes with the others, and
progress results from this competition. But this is to see merely the advantages and

ignore the disadvantages, and I cannot support such a theory. Society exists, and a
State has been founded. Although people desire to rise to positions of wealth and
honor, the social order and the tranquillity of the State will be disrupted if this is
done egoistically. Men should not do battle in competition with their fellow men.
Therefore, I believe that in order to get along together in society and serve the State,
we must by all means abandon this idea of independence and self-reliance and reject
egoism completely.

CHAPTER 27
WOMEN AND EDUCATION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
The spread of education was one of the key developments in nineteenth-century
world history. It began in the West, which already had reasonably extensive literacy
and schooling. New political ideas, associated with the revolutionary era, pushed
leaders to think about greater access to education in order to create opportunities
for the lower classes and to produce better-informed (or more loyal) citizens.
Children were increasingly cherished, particularly in middle-class ideology, and this
led to the belief that they deserved the chance to learn—perhaps to learn even more
than their parents had. Industrialization prompted demands for a better-trained
workforce, able to do some arithmetic and capable of reading factory rules and
consumer advertisements. As factories became more complex, child labor became
less useful—another reason to think about schooling.
Given the Western example, which seemed to demonstrate that modern,
widespread education was crucial to the operation of effective states and to
economic growth, many societies began to follow suit. Japan, with a large school
system already, decreed mass education in 1872 and also began to replace pure
Confucianism with science and technology in the higher schools. Russia expanded its
schools, and reform regimes in Latin America began to do the same.
The spread of education is already a vital topic in nineteenth-century world
history. But there’s an additional, important twist, which makes it a fundamental
topic in women’s world history as well.
For everywhere, the expansion of education involved women, despite the
widespread belief that women were intellectually inferior to men. Officials realized
that women might have as much use for basic reading and arithmetic skills as men,
if only to hold factory jobs (in the working class) or run a household (in all classes)
or raise intelligent sons. Further, women’s special roles might require an additional,
special kind of education, stressing domestic skills, virtue, and graceful arts such as
piano playing. Some women leaders, furthermore, developed still other arguments,
based on claims of equal access not just to schools but also to jobs that depended on
education.
Women began to catch up with men in literacy and basic skills, at the primary
level, at least. They lagged in higher schooling, but here too, by the late nineteenth
century, a growing minority of middle-class women began to press into American
high schools or the sex-segregated secondary schools in France. A handful even
entered universities; a few were admitted to professional schools in areas such as
medicine.
At the same time, different regions developed different approaches to women’s
educational issues. This was true within the West and certainly true when other
societies, including colonies like India, are considered. It was true that the spread of
Western imperialism carried certain Western ideas about women to other countries.
But in many cases women were newly exploited, as colonial authorities sought
cheap labor for export industries. Many colonial women seemed exotic and debased,
because of the different costumes they wore; both sexual exploitation and moralistic
preachments resulted, from Africa to Hawaii. But where Western influence was
particularly pervasive, additional signals were sometimes conveyed.

India was an obvious case in point. Effective British economic and military
dominance of much of the subcontinent was established in the eighteenth century.
During the nineteenth century, the British imposed fuller political control. For the
most part, the British were content to leave Indian culture alone, but inevitably
some new ideas gained entrance. The British tried to outlaw the practice of suttee,
wherein some Indian wives killed themselves after their husbands had died on
grounds that there was nothing more to live for.
Other developments in India included efforts to set up new types of schooling,
including some for women. The third section that follows, a British observer’s
assessment, deals with these changes. The result, as in Europe, was a confusing
pattern. Real innovation did occur: some women received an education that Indian
women had never before enjoyed. Western influences interacted with older
traditions but also new Indian initiatives in a complex mixture. How did the
resultant combination compare with the complex developments affecting women in
the West?
Questions
1. How did Necker de Saussure define appropriate education for women? How fully
did she accept the domesticity arguments? How did she manage to argue for
additional educational goals?
2. What is the nature of Duffey’s argument for women’s education? How does it
compare with that of Necker de Saussure? Does the comparison suggest any
pattern of similarities and differences in nineteenth-century situations for women
in France and the United States? Do the different ideas about education relate to
different family ideals in France and the United States?
3. How does Stanton’s educational experience demonstrate the special limitations on
women? How does it also demonstrate new opportunities?
4. Stanton was obviously an unusual woman, from an unusual family: did she reflect
the more standard assumptions and situations at all? How does her actual
educational experience compare with Duffey’s arguments about women’s
education?
5. How does Stanton’s experience help explain her leadership in American feminism?
6. What changes occurred in Indian education the later nineteenth century? Why did
the changes occur? What were the limitations on educational goals?
7. How did Indian educational change and constraint compare with patterns in
women’s educational goals and experiences in the West?
8. How did many nineteenth-century women in France, India, and the United States
accept and even encourage ideas and institutions that other women, at that time
and since, have found unjust? Why did these accommodations occur?
For Further Discussion
1. Why, given various prejudices against women, did women’s education advance at
all in the nineteenth century? How did educational gains relate to other changes
and continuities in the lives of adult women—did education change more or less
than other aspects of life?
2. Considering education and family trends, do France and the United States fall
within a common Western pattern with regard to nineteenth-century women, or
do the differences suggest that the United States was a distinctive civilization?

3. Is westernization a useful concept in describing educational changes for uppercaste women in India? Or were special Indian features still predominant even
amid change?
4. How do educational changes and ideas about women’s education help explain the
rise of feminism in the nineteenth century? Why was feminism stronger in the
United States than in France, and in the West generally, than in India?
5. How have twentieth-century women’s patterns in the West and in India altered
nineteenth-century developments? To what extent do they still reflect nineteenthcentury issues?
FRANCE
This selection was written in 1838 by Albertine-Adrienne Necker de Saussure. Necker
de Saussure was a Protestant of Swiss origin, but she was widely known in France.
She had earlier written on more general educational issues. Her later book, from
which this passage is taken, argued for a domestic education, granting women’s
special roles in marriage while pushing for a wider educational range.

(Philadelphia, 1844), 27–29, 71, 74–75.
•••
The same gospel which says “Women, submit yourselves to your own husbands,”
teaches [them] also that there is no inequality among human beings in the sight of
God. “Ye are all the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ.” “There is neither bond
nor free, there is neither male nor female, for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.”
But this part of our celestial nature which education should constantly seek to
bring out, man has scarcely taken into account. He has had this life only in view,
and has shut his eyes upon whatever limited his rights here. He has seen only the
wife in the woman—in the young girl only the future wife. All the faculties, the
qualities which have no immediate relation to his interests, have seemed to him
worthless. Yet there are many of the gifts bestowed upon woman that have no
relation to the state of a wife. This state, although natural, is not necessary—perhaps
half the women who now exist, have not been, or are no longer, married. In the
indigent classes, the girl who is able to maintain herself, quits her parents, and
supports herself by her industry for a long time, perhaps for life, without requiring
aid from man. No social arrangements oblige her to become dependent. It is
therefore important, that education should unfold in the young girl the qualities
which give the surest promise of wisdom, happiness, usefulness, and dignity,
whatever may be her lot.…
If we would have the selfishness of men plainly exhibited, let us listen to
Rousseau.
“All the education of women should bear a relation to men—to please, to be
useful to them—to possess their love and esteem, to educate them in childhood, to
nurse them when grown up, to counsel, to console, to make their lives pleasant and
sweet; such are the duties of women and should be taught to them from infancy.”
If Rousseau had said that the education of women should bear a relation to what
surrounds them, to the beings with whom nature or love had entwined their fate, we
would applaud this language. Why particularly designate men? Why teach young
girls to consider their own sex as nothing? and why give to the necessity of loving

the most dangerous tendency?…
… Sisters brought up with their brothers would be subject to the same rules and
duties, justice and truth being the only means employed to guide them. In this
common education, there must be more firmness, less flattery; the promises and
menaces of opinion, to which boys are comparatively insensible, are rarely
employed. The motives proposed to all the children are those of goodness, reason,
and true moral philosophy, adapted to their comprehension.
Since the comparative weakness of girls is rarely manifested before the age of ten
years, why should they be freed from the laws of natural equality? Why led to
calculate upon accommodations and consideration from the other sex? Many sad
disappointments are thus prepared for them.…
Obedience is so important an element in education, it is so truly the first duty of
childhood, and the way to observe every other, that in this respect no difference can
be made in the education of the two sexes. However, docility, that internal
disposition which naturally leads to the fulfillment of this duty, may well be the
object of peculiar cultivation in young girls. Whenever boys are placed under public
instruction, they are rather governed by general rules than by the will of individuals.
Women, on the contrary, are called to bear, very often, and perhaps throughout their
lives, the yoke of personal obedience. Since such is their fate, it is well to accustom
them to it; they must learn to yield without even an internal murmur. Their gayety,
their health, their equality of temper, will all gain by a prompt and cordial docility.
…
Hence we would exhort mothers always to exercise fearlessly the authority with
which God has entrusted them, since this also is sacred authority. Even though they
might obtain the accomplishment of their plans in some other way, it would be
important to accustom their daughters to submission. We would suggest that long
expositions of motives invite objections, and seem to show that resistance is
expected. It is with little girls especially that it is important to prevent rejoinders,
the habit of contradicting and of arguing on all occasions.…
In cherishing this sentiment you will also cultivate in your daughter other
qualities: you will endow her with patience, resignation, and all the gentle virtues
that a woman is infallibly called to exercise. To the caprices of fortune will be
added, for her discipline, those of mankind. A multitude of illusive hopes and
disappointed expectations form a part of her fate. Her best plans will be overturned:
her occupations interrupted, she will have to suffer in silence humiliations and
distresses still more poignant. But when, gentle and patient, she shall have supported
all such trials, a high degree of virtue will be developed within her.
[Here is Necker de Saussure’s schedule for organizing the hours in a young girl’s
day.]
Religious duties: worship and various exercises, 1
Literary and scientific studies—intellectual cultivation: elements of calculation
and physical science, languages, history and geography, exercises of memory, 4
[total]
Fine arts: music and drawing, 1.5
Material duties and occupations: physical exercise, 1.5; female work and domestic
care, 1.5; liberty, meals, and family circle, 4.5
On looking over the above plan, we see at once that the larger portion of the time

is appropriated to recreations or duties purely material, and the smaller portion to
study. It seems to us, therefore, that we cannot be accused of requiring too much
mental application from young girls. But we can never approve of any diminution of
the time claimed for purely intellectual education. If, then, we wish to preserve
intact the four previous hours employed to develop the magnificent gift of
intelligence, it is essential to lose not a moment; long preparations, idle words, must
be prohibited, and this alone would be a valuable habit. The power of promptly
fixing the attention forms what is called presence of mind, and also gives nerve to
the character.…
THE UNITED STATES
The following two selections come from a proponent not only of women’s education
but also of coeducation, Eliza Duffey (d. 1898), and from the reminiscences of the
tireless nineteenth-century feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815–1902). Duffey,
writing in 1874, argued vigorously against limitations on women. Her work was part
of the growing movement for more rounded education, including higher education
and exercise—a movement that produced a growing number of women’s colleges; it
also resulted in women’s gradual entry into high schools and coeducational colleges.
Stanton, who married and had several children, was one of the distinctive
personalities of nineteenth-century American history and a person of tremendous
energy and persistence. By the late nineteenth century, along with a few other
leaders, she helped shape the movement that would soon lead to the granting of the
vote to women (in 1920; women’s suffrage in France did not arrive until 1945).
•••
ELIZA DUFFEY

As infancy begins to give place to childhood, then the distinctive training
commences in earnest. The boy is allowed to be natural, the girl is forced to be
artificial. Some girls break through all restraints and romp, but they are not the
model girls whom mothers delight in and visitors praise for being “lady-like.” Boy
and girl as they are, with the same life pulsing in their veins and drawing its
sustenance in precisely the same manner, with the same physical and mental needs,
nature calls imperatively for an equally active life for both. They both want the air
and the sunshine. They need equally to be hardened by the storms, tanned by the
winds and have limbs strengthened by unrestrained exercise. But instead of this
equality, while boys have their liberty more or less freely granted them, girls must
stay at home and sew and read, and play prettily and quietly, and take demure
walks. I am not speaking of girls in a single stratum of society, but of girls
everywhere, from the highest down almost to the lowest, wherever the word “lady”
is sufficiently reverenced and misunderstood.…
From Eliza Duffey, No Sex in Education; or, An Equal Chance for Both Girls and
Boys (Philadelphia, 1874), 40, 43, 100, 101.
Girls, whose energies are still the most powerful, have no opportunity for working
off their surplus vitality in rude and boisterous ways, for the restraint is never lifted
from them. So they enter with the whole force of their natures into their studies,
and, as every teacher will bear testimony, soon far outstrip their brothers. To be at
the head of their class, to receive the highest mark of merit, is their ruling ambition.
Their minds are prematurely developed at the expense of their bodies. This does not
result because they are educated as boys, but because both are educated wrongly,

and the girl far more wrongly than the boy, inasmuch and just so far as her
education in the general discipline of her life differs from that of the boy.…
When we still further admit that in matters of fresh air, exercise and dress girls
almost invariably labor under disadvantages which boys do not feel, I think there
has been sufficient admitted to account for all failures (supposing there to be any)
of girls in keeping healthful as well as mental pace with boys. It is pernicious habits
in these respects which need looking after and correcting—these and the further and
to my mind still more important fact that at the close of her school-days is removed
a girl’s mental stimulus, and she is left to collapse. Set these things right, and let
girls find a “career” open to them, and education will take care of itself.
If there is really a radical mental difference in men and women founded upon sex,
you cannot educate them alike, however much you try. If women cannot study
unremittingly, why then they will not, and you cannot make them. But because they
do, because they choose so to do, because they will do so in spite of you, should be
accepted as evidence that they can, and, all other things being equal, can with
impunity. Instead of our race dying out through these women, they are the hope of
the country—the women with broad chests, large limbs and full veins, perfect
muscular and digestive systems and harmonious sexual organs, who will keep pace
with men either in a foot or an intellectual race, who know perfectly their own
powers and are not afraid to tax them to their utmost, knowing as they do that
action generates force. These are the mothers of the coming race. … The result will
be truly “the survival of the fittest.”
ELIZABETH CADY STANTON

When I was eleven years old, two events occurred which changed considerably the
current of my life. My only brother, who had just graduated from Union College,
came home to die. A young man of great talent and promise, he was the pride of my
father’s heart. We early felt that this son filled a larger place in our father’s
affections and future plans than the five daughters together. Well do I remember
how tenderly he watched my brother in his last illness, the sighs and tears he gave
vent to as he slowly walked up and down the hall, and, when the last sad moment
came, and we were all assembled to say farewell in the silent chamber of death, how
broken were his utterances as he knelt and prayed for comfort and support. … As he
took no notice of me, after standing a long while, I climbed upon his knee, when he
mechanically put his arm about me and, with my head resting against his beating
heart, we both sat in silence, he thinking of the wreck of all his hopes in the loss of a
dear son, and I wondering what could be said or done to fill the void in his breast.
At length he heaved a deep sigh and said: “Oh, my daughter, I wish you were a boy!”
Throwing my arms about his neck, I replied: “I will try to be all my brother was.”
From Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Eighty Years and More: Reminiscence, 1815–1897
(Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1993), 10–23.
Then and there I resolved that I would not give so much time as heretofore to
play, but would study and strive to be at the head of all my classes and thus delight
my father’s heart. All that day and far into the night I pondered the problem of
boyhood. I thought that the chief thing to be done in order to equal boys was to be
learned and courageous. So I decided to study Greek and learn to manage a horse.
Having formed this conclusion I fell asleep. My resolutions, unlike many such made
at night, did not vanish with the coming light. I arose early and hastened to put
them into execution. They were resolutions never to be forgotten—destined to mold

my character anew. As soon as I was dressed I hastened to our good pastor, Rev.
Simon Hosack, who was always early at work in his garden.
“Doctor,” said I, “which do you like best, boys or girls?”
“Why, girls, to be sure; I would not give you for all the boys in Christendom.”
“My father,” I replied, “prefers boys; he wishes I was one, and I intend to be as
near like one as possible. I am going to ride on horseback and study Greek. Will you
give me a Greek lesson now, doctor? I want to begin at once.”
“Yes, child,” said he, throwing down his hoe, “come into my library and we will
begin without delay.”…
During all this time I kept up my lessons at the parsonage and made rapid
progress. I surprised even my teacher, who thought me capable of doing anything. I
learned to drive, and to leap a fence and ditch on horseback. I taxed every power,
hoping some day to hear my father say: “Well, a girl is as good as a boy, after all.”
But he never said it. When the doctor came over to spend the evening with us, I
would whisper in his ear: “Tell my father how fast I get on,” and he would tell him,
and was lavish in his praises. But my father only paced the room, sighed, and
showed that he wished I were a boy; and I, not knowing why he felt thus, would
hide my tears of vexation on the doctor’s shoulder.
Soon after this I began to study Latin, Greek, and mathematics with a class of
boys in the Academy, many of whom were much older than I. For three years one
boy kept his place at the head of the class, and I always stood next. Two prizes were
offered in Greek. I strove for one and took the second. How well I remember my joy
in receiving that prize. There was no sentiment of ambition, rivalry, or triumph over
my companions, nor feeling of satisfaction in receiving this honor in the presence of
those assembled on the day of the exhibition. One thought alone filled my mind.
“Now,” said I, “my father will be satisfied with me.” So, as soon as we were
dismissed, I ran down the hill, rushed breathless into his office, laid the new Greek
Testament, which was my prize, on his table and exclaimed: “There, I got it!” He
took up the book, asked me some questions about the class, the teachers, the
spectators, and, evidently pleased, handed it back to me. Then, while I stood looking
and waiting for him to say something which would show that he recognized the
equality of the daughter with the son, he kissed me on the forehead and exclaimed,
with a sigh, “Ah, you should have been a boy!”
INDIA
The following selection, written around 1905, comes from a book by a British
educational authority from a women’s college in Oxford University, Minna G.
Cowan. The report raises obvious questions about possible bias: what other kinds of
data would help in assessing educational developments in India during the period?
How did the directions of change, and the levels of female educational access,
compare to Western patterns? Why did any change occur at all?
•••
The Calcutta School Society ascertained in 1818 that no provision of any kind
existed for the education of women, and an attempted estimate of their general
literacy places the figure at one in a hundred thousand. The old ideal had so utterly
vanished, that it needed the touch of Western civilization to revive even the
conception of its former existence. This existence, shadowy and faint though it may
appear in our eyes, is an enormous asset to the new movement in a country where

everything Aryan and Vedic counts for much in the endeavor to create a national
consciousness.
The modern epoch is thus in part a Renaissance, in part the introduction once
more of the ideal of another faith. It will occupy our attention in detail and falls
naturally into three periods. The first dates from 1819, when the Baptist Mission in
Calcutta started its first school for girls till 1854, during which time the influence
was almost entirely that of the women missionaries; the second, from the famous
Educational Despatch of 1854 til 1884, is characterized by the [colonial]
Government policy of “grants-in-aid” to voluntary associations, by the first tentative
beginnings of direct Government effort, and by the expansion of Secondary
education under missionary auspices; in the modern period dating from the
presentation of the report of Sir William Hunter’s Commission in 1884, the
Government share in girls’ education is much more direct, the spontaneous Indian
element enters more strongly, and for the first time the question of a differentiation
in the curriculum arises.…
From Minna G. Cowan, The Education of Women in India (New York: Fleming H.
Revell, 1912), 34–35, 36–37, 38–41, 44–45, 47–50, 51–52, 53.
The education given by the women missionaries consisted of such mere rudiments
as were possible under the conditions and for the short period during which their
pupils were available. In 1852 a second stage of missionary education was reached
by the establishment in Calcutta of a Normal School for the training of Christian
female teachers under the auspices of the society known later as the Zenana Bible
and Medical Mission.
By the great educational charter of 1854, the Government adopted the policy of
fostering and encouraging private effort by a system of grants-in-aid to all
institutions which could comply with certain stipulations as to buildings, number of
teachers, textbooks and type of instruction given. Religious instruction might be
given but did not come within the purview of the Government officials. Departments
of Public Instruction were formed, Inspectors appointed, and the well known scheme
of examinations inaugurated. It is stated in the Despatch that female education shall
be given “frank and cordial support.”
“The importance of female education in India cannot be over-rated, and we have
observed with pleasure the evidence which is now afforded of an increased desire on
the part of many of the natives of India to give a good education to their daughters.
By these means a far greater proportional impulse is imparted to the educational
and moral tone of the people than by the education of men.”
The Agra experiment was the response of Government to spontaneous Indian
effort, and as the world of the Hindu pioneer who was its originator is little known,
the following account may be quoted.
[From an 1860 colonial government report:] “Even in our Asiatic Provinces,
before the breaking out of the troubles, a desire had sprung up among the natives to
extend the blessings of education to women. Gopal Singh, a Hindu gentleman,
holding under Government the post of district Inspector of native schools, had
succeeded, through his own exertions, in establishing upwards of two hundred
seminaries for young ladies in the Province of Agra which were attended by 3800
girls of the best families. By many of our countrymen in India, this is regarded
rather as a social revolution than as an educational movement. As a rule, the natives
look with suspicion on everything which comes from a foreigner, for which reason
the great efforts made by the English have not produced corresponding results. ‘The

establishment of a little school,’ observes the local ruler, ‘which my own daughters
and those of my immediate friends and relations attend at first like a charm,
dispelled in a great measure the prejudices of my neighbours, and induced many to
send their girls also. This example and my constant persuasion and reasoning have
at last succeeded in inducing many respectable inhabitants of other villages to yield.’
And so the movement bids fair to become national. The pupils are nearly all Hindus
belonging to the more respectable classes. The teachers are all men.”
The curriculum seems to have been somewhat different from that of the boys’
schools, and the leader notes with satisfaction: “Girls are possessed of better
memories and less selfishness than boys.” The success and extent of the movement
seems however to have been due to the personal influence of this one man, and with
the passing of his generation the schools degenerated in type. The rapid extension of
this work under Government into other districts necessitated the employment once
more of men teachers. Four female Normal schools were established which appear
to have been such only in name. Two British Inspectresses were appointed whose
reports indicate the same problems as those of a more modern date. “The villages
are not opposed to the school but they value them chiefly as a means of support for
Brahmans [priests] and relatives.” They could not believe that the Government were
in earnest on the subject, when the girls school was accommodated in a place not
more attractive than a cow-shed and the boys’ in a handsome building. In 1876, a
drastic reduction of 212 schools took place and the question of female education
dropped into abeyance for a period. The official comment thereon was that the State
had incurred much expense in founding and maintaining these schools and that the
results had been painfully disappointing. Historically, the experiment indicates the
danger of extending girls’ schools beyond the desire of the community and beyond
the possibility of constant supervision on the part of British Inspectresses. The
solution of the ever present problem of a supply of teachers was only a temporary
one, and the failure of the Normal schools was attributed largely to the lack of a
British superintendent.
The activity of Christian missions during this period seems extraordinary, when
the difficulties which hampered Government efforts are considered. Moreover, all
their educational work was handicapped, so far as numbers were concerned, by the
frank and open avowal of the desire to win their pupils ultimately for Christianity.
The missionaries had, however, at their command the one essential asset—Western
women who were willing to give themselves heart and soul to the work. Eight new
women’s societies, both British and American, entered India between 1860 and
1870, and educational work was their most effective means of contact with the
people. Their pupils in the Primary stages were drawn both from the non-Christian
population and from the orphans and converts in connection with the missions. As it
was possible to retain the Christian girls, and even some of the others for longer
than the usual period, owing to the exclusion of men teachers from the mission
schools, a Secondary system on identical lines with that for boys began to be slowly
built up.
Of the [government] aided schools there is no separate official classification to
show what proportion are managed by Indian committees, and what by missionary
agencies. Where possible this has been indicated from local information in the
chapters on the separate provinces. The Indian spontaneous element has become
however much stronger during this modern period,… while probably the most
remarkable feature in the Indian government is the establishment of girls’ schools
under committees of Indian gentlemen representing different faiths. This indigenous

movement is due in part to a desire to provide a good education without direct
interference with the religion of the pupils, and in part to a reaction from the
extreme secularism and the Westernizing influences of the Government schools.
In spite of the recent rapid increase and the steady progress of the last twenty
years, the percentage of girls of school age attending school is only 4.6, and the
desire for education has still in many places to be created.
This small proportion indicates, apart from the social and religious customs
which cause it, a lack of balance in the whole system. Are the circumstances under
which higher education is given not such as commend themselves to the Indian
mind? Or is the course of studies pursued not of sufficiently practical and
educational value to prove attractive to Indian women? Is there any foundation for
the popular belief that the physique of Indian girls is not strong enough for a
prolonged school course?
The problem of the curriculum is a very subtle one. In the early days of the
reform of girls’ education in Great Britian, about 1862, the greatest need seemed to
be the adoption of an adequate test of knowledge, and that test one already
recognized, so that there might seem to be no lower requirement to suit the
supposed lower capacity of the feminine mind. The same principle worked in the
early days of girls’ education in India and preparation for Matriculation seemed the
only means by which the standard could be raised. Whereas in Great Britain the
leading girls’ High schools have developed a flexibility and variety of curriculum
wherein many a “womanly woman” has found her training, even if she did not
prefer to seek her education in one of the numerous excellent private schools, the
girls’ curriculum for Indian girls has been stereotyped on masculine lines. If we
assume that education should prepare for future life, it seems clearly wrong that the
preparation for spheres so totally different as those of Indian men and women
should be identical.…

PART V

The Contemporary Period, 1914–Present
THE TWENTIETH AND EARLY TWENTY-FIRST CENTURIES have been so rich in events that their

status as the opening of a new world history period must seem assured. Two world
wars followed by a long Cold War (followed by its end, in turn, in 1989); major
revolutions in Russia, China, Mexico, and Iran and many smaller upheavals
elsewhere; the advent of the nuclear age; unprecedented population growth, which,
along with intensifying global industrialization, helped significantly to alter the
environment; the advent of airplanes, television, computers—the list seems almost
endless. Of course, many centuries seem more full of change at the time than they
turn out to be in retrospect; but recent decades unquestionably claim a place at the
top of any list. The problem is to sort out the main lines of development.
Several major themes defined the contemporary period, from World War I
onward, as a new period in world history; each of the themes carries important
challenges for comparative analysis.
First, most societies had to reconsider established political, cultural, and social
systems and replace them with new alternatives. Monarchy, empire, and aristocracy
all declined. Some societies indeed introduced a series of innovations. By the 1990s,
few civilizations outside the West had the same political system that they had had in
1900. The end of colonialism and many revolutions required innovation. Population
growth, particularly outside the industrialized centers, provided a massive prod for
social, cultural and political change. Older belief systems, ranging from adherence to
one of the major religions to the deeply rooted polytheism of areas such as subSaharan Africa, faced new rivals in movements such as nationalism and Communism
and in popular cultural exports from the West. Increasing capacity for global
transportation and communication, from radio to the internet, set the technological
basis for dramatic new relationships.
Comparison category number one, then, involves juxtaposing the nature of change
and innovation in two or more societies. Was the widespread movement toward
authoritarian nationalism—called fascism in its most extreme form—the same in its
major European centers of power and elsewhere? How much did the leading
Communist regimes have in common? How did different societies handle new
activities by religious missionaries plus strong influences from Western consumer
culture? How did societies with different traditions about families and conditions for
women respond to the huge surge in the population growth rate? The list of
comparative responses to common processes, in a period of great innovation, is a
long one.
International contacts. This was not a brand new development, for the pattern
had been installed at least a thousand years before. But new levels of
communication and trade unquestionably produced a substantive change in the rates
and impacts of exchange. By the end of the century over a quarter of the world’s
population might watch a single sporting event on television, World Cup soccer
heading the list. Meetings of scientists drew experts from every corner of the globe
who shared common methods and assumptions, whatever their specific cultural
backgrounds—another first in world history. Several societies, like Russia and China,
that attempted considerable isolation for part of the twentieth century, decided to
embrace greater globalization by the 1980s, mainly in the interest of greater
economic prosperity.

The broad question for comparison category number two is, How did different
societies respond to the new levels of contact? What kind of international
interaction was responsible for the striking spread of political democracy at the
century’s end? How, on the other hand, might some societies try to insulate
themselves from too much challenging contact?
Third, the relative power of the West declined. This change reversed five centuries
of Western ascendancy, but it showed clearly in the declining military and political
dominance of the West, even with the United States included. Moscow’s
decolonization was a key development; so, by 2000, was rapid economic growth in
East Asia, India, and elsewhere. Yet—partly because of the growing role of the
United States in world affairs—Western influence remained high, and its cultural
impact on other parts of the world may have exceeded developments in previous
centuries. Western countries could no longer retain their colonies, but they could
distribute new styles of clothing, like blue jeans; new youth music; new kinds of
restaurants, like McDonald’s; new films and TV shows (Baywatch became for a time
the world’s most widely viewed television series); scientific discoveries; and even
“international” artistic styles.
For comparative category number three, we examine the complex balance
between new opportunities for global diversity, as the West’s power declined, and
new signs of looking to the West for models. Nationalism spread widely around the
world and allowed many countries to praise distinctive features of their traditions;
but the desire for national strength and respectability could lead to further
borrowings from the West. Along with all the new events of this busy period, the
new-old patterns of interaction with the West constitute perhaps the most obvious
sign of a time of transition to which different societies responded differently, with
responses sometimes changing as the century wore on.
It was not clear, by the early twenty-first century, that any single civilization
center was poised to replace the West as the dominant world civilization. Perhaps,
for a time at least, there might be none. It is important to remember that the
twentieth century as the opening of a new period was just that, an opening; all sorts
of clarifications might follow in subsequent decades, as has been the case in world
history transitions previously. In the meantime, societies outside the West, aware of
lingering Western power and the siren call of claims to cultural leadership, had to
make their own adjustments to continuing, sometimes novel forms of Western
influence.
For, as in earlier periods of world history, novel forces elicited somewhat different
responses depending on the civilization. Some societies were more open to
international contacts than others. Some responded to the need for political change
with democracy—India is a case in point—while others, such as China, innovated
while explicitly rejecting pluralist democracy. As in previous eras, world history
continued to involve comparing reactions to some common trends and impulses.
The relative decline of the West, intensifying international contacts, and the need to
reconsider traditional political, social, and cultural patterns affected virtually all
regions; but the results varied, because of particular twentieth-century settings and
diverse prior traditions. Careful comparison remains essential, even among the
societies that seemed most eagerly to embrace “international” trends.
The chapters that follow tackle issues of political change by discussing both new
forms of authoritarian government and the rise of democracy in additional areas of
the world, as well as outright revolution. They deal with world power balance in

discussing the atomic bomb and terrorism. They deal with cultural innovations
through nationalism, changes in religious balance, and the pressure of consumer
values. Shifts in women’s expectations and related changes in population behaviors
and policies form another vital category. In all these areas, the mixture of
innovation with defense of older identities, the pressure of new global contacts, and
changes in world power balance, along with the continuing prestige of the West,
shaped the framework in which particular societies developed patterns that can best
be assessed through comparison.

CHAPTER 28
TWENTIETH-CENTURY REVOLUTIONS
The second decade of the twentieth century witnessed the early stages of three of the
most important revolutions that ever occurred in world history: the Mexican, the
Chinese, and the Russian. These revolutions helped set the stage for later uprisings,
particularly in the 1950s–1970s decades, in various parts of Latin America,
including Cuba, in Vietnam, and elsewhere. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 must be
added to the list, though it had rather different bases.
Revolutions helped spur many of the key changes of the twentieth century,
including the decline of monarchy and the fading of the aristocracy. They resulted in
new cultural efforts, including expansion of education. They affected global politics,
setting up new divisions between revolutionary and conservative powers. The tide of
revolution may have ebbed by the 1990s, with the collapse of many Communist
systems, but even if this proves true, revolution had been involved in many of the
most important developments in contemporary world history thus far.
Revolutions obviously invite comparison. Each has a distinctive flavor and cast of
characters. But revolutions also share some common dynamics and, in the twentieth
century, some common causes. Comparison must also extend to impact: what were
the durable political and social results in each case? What were the effects on the
rest of the world?
Mexico’s revolution broke out in 1910, against the aging dictatorship of Porfirio
Diaz. Various components in the revolution included liberal elements and peasant
protesters. From 1920 onward, after a decade of unrest, the revolution began to
consolidate a new political system. While the Mexican Revolution did not produce
immediate contagion elsewhere, its example helped spur social protests later, in
other parts of Latin America.
Chinese revolutionaries toppled the ancient empire in 1911–1912, aided by the
presence of a boy as latest official emperor. Sun Yat-sen was the leading
revolutionary spokesperson. Efforts to construct a durable new system faltered,
however, amid provincial disunity and, by the 1930s, Japanese invasion. Only after
World War II did a Communist regime win out, ending the explicitly revolutionary
period.
Russia had a preliminary revolution in 1905, which did not, however, induce the
tsar to introduce significant reforms, particularly in the political arena. The
hardships of World War I combined with more basic unrest to generate a major
revolution in 1917, quickly captured by Vladimir Lenin and his Bolshevik wing of
the Communist party. Roughly six years of conflict followed before the Communists
were able to begin consolidating their rule. Lenin’s interpretation of Marxism, and
the success of the revolution, had wide impact on many other parts of the world,
through the Cold War and until the collapse of the Bolshevik regime in 1989–1891.
Questions
1. How did the goals of the Mexican and Russian Revolutions compare? What were
the major similarities and differences?
2. Is Sun Yat-sen best viewed as a modem interpreter of Chinese tradition or as a
revolutionary westernizer?

3. How did Sun Yat-sen’s approach compare with those of revolutionaries in Mexico
and Russia?
4. How did Sun Yat-sen and Lenin compare in their views of how to organize a
revolution?
5. Why and how did peasant concerns loom large in twentieth-century revolutions?
6. How did the Communist approach to peasant issues compare with reform
approaches in Mexico and China? What was the relationship between the
Communist approach and peasant grievances and aspirations?
7. What was the interaction between political and social goals in the three
revolutions?
8. Do the documents suggest any causes of the differences among the three
revolutions? What other kind of material would help to deal with this issue?
For Further Discussion
1. Do these documents suggest why these three revolutions would have different
outcomes? Or why they would have different types and levels of impact in other
parts of the world?
2. How do twentieth-century revolutions, in goals, organizations, and results,
compare with the Atlantic revolutions of the 1770s–1820 period?
3. How would Western governments, including the United States, react to these three
revolutions?
4. Is the contemporary age of revolution over? What has happened to the causes and
ideals of these revolutions a century later?
MEXICO
FRANCISCO MADERO: THE PLAN OF SAN LUIS POTOSI, NOVEMBER 20, 1910

Madero was a middle-class, liberal politician who took charge of the early phase of
the Mexican revolution, in direct opposition to the previous, authoritarian regime of
Porfirio Diaz. He issued the Plan of San Luis Potosi after Diaz stole the Mexican
election of 1910 by having Madero arrested and imprisoned. Madero fled to San
Antonio and issued the Plan of San Luis Potosi calling for the nullification of the
elections and upon Mexicans to take up arms against the government. The date of its
issue marks the beginning of the Mexican Revolution.
•••
Peoples, in their constant efforts for the triumph of the ideal of liberty and justice,
are forced, at precise historical moments, to make their greatest sacrifices.
Our beloved country has reached one of those moments. A force of tyranny which
we Mexicans were not accustomed to suffer after we won our independence
oppresses us in such a manner that it has become intolerable.…
The legislative and judicial powers are completely subordinated to the executive,
the division of powers, the sovereignty of the states, the liberty of the common
councils, and the rights of the citizens exist only in writing in our great charter; but,
as a fact, it may almost be said that martial law constantly exists in Mexico; the
administration of justice, instead of imparting protection to the weak, merely serves
to legalize the plunderings committed by the strong; the judges instead of being the
representatives of justice, are the agents of the executive, whose interests they

faithfully serve; the chambers of the union have no other will than that of the
dictator; the governors of the States are designated by him and they in their turn
designate and impose in like manner the municipal authorities. From this it results
that the whole administrative, judicial, and legislative machinery obeys a single will,
the caprice of General Porfirio Diaz, who during this long administration has shown
that the principle motive that guides him is to maintain himself in power and at any
cost.…
In Mexico, as a democratic Republic, the public power can have no other origin
nor other basis than the will of the people, and the latter can not be subordinated to
formulas to be executed in a fraudulent manner.…
For this reason the Mexican people have protested against the illegality of the last
election and, desiring to use successively all the recourses offered by the laws of the
Republic, in due form asked for the nullification of the election by the Chamber of
Deputies, notwithstanding they recognized no legal origin in said body and knew
beforehand that, as its members were not the representatives of the people, they
would carry out the will of General Diaz, to whom exclusively they owe their
investiture. In such a state of affairs the people, who are the only sovereign, also
protested energetically against the election in imposing manifestations in different
parts of the Republic.…
But such conduct was indispensable to show to the whole world that the Mexican
people are fit for democracy, that they are thirsty for liberty, and that their present
rulers do not measure up to their aspirations.
Besides, the attitude of the people before and during the election, as well as
afterwards, shows clearly that they reject the energy of the Government of General
Diaz and that, if those electoral rights had been respected, I would have been elected
for President of the Republic.
Therefore, and in echo of the national will, I declare the late election illegal and,
the Republic being accordingly without rulers, provisionally assume the Presidency
of the Republic until the people designate their rulers pursuant to the law. In order
to attain this end, it is necessary to eject from power the audacious usurpers whose
only title of legality involves a scandalous and immoral fraud.
With all honesty I declare that it would be a weakness on my part and treason to
the people, who have placed their confidence in me, not to put myself at the front of
my fellow citizens, who anxiously call me from all parts of the country, to compel
General Diaz by force of arms, to respect the national will.
THE PLAN OF AYALA

This document was issued by the radical peasant leader Emiliano Zapata, in 1911.
Zapata never managed to seize power, but his economic demands, and his ability to
rouse the peasantry in several key regions, affected Mexican social and political
development for many decades.
•••
[We hereby proclaim] the liberating plan of the sons of the State of Morelos,
affiliated with the Insurgent Army which defends the fulfillment of the Plan of San
Luis Potosi, with the reforms which they have believed necessary to add for the
benefit of the Mexican Fatherland.
We, the subscribers [to this Plan], constituted in a Revolutionary Council…
declare solemnly before the countenance of the civilized world which judges us and

before the Nation to which we belong and love, the principles which we have
formulated to terminate the tyranny which oppresses us and redeem the Fatherland
from the dictatorships which are imposed on us, which are determined in the
following plan:
Justicia y ley. [Justice and Law.] Ayala, 28 November, 1911. From Emiliano Zapata,
The Plan of Ayala (29 November, 1911), translated by Erick Langer.
1. [Accuses Francisco I. Madero, the leader of the 1910 revolution and president of
Mexico, of betraying the revolution and allying himself with the oppressive old
guard in the State of Morelos.]
2. Francisco I. Madero is disavowed as Chief of the Revolution and as President of
the Republic, for the above reasons, [and we will] endeavor to overthrow this
official.
3. The illustrious General Pascual Orozco, second of the caudillo Don Francisco I.
Madero, is recognized as Chief of the Liberating Revolution, and in case he does not
accept this delicate post, General Emiliano Zapata is recognized Chief of the
Revolution.
4. The Revolutionary Junta of the Sate of Morelos manifest the following formal
points… and will make itself the defender of the principles that it will defend until
victory or death.
5. The Revolutionary Junta of the State of Morelos will not admit transactions or
political compromises until the overthrow of the dictatorial elements of Porfirio
Diaz and Francisco I. Madero, since the Nation is tired of false men and traitors who
make promises as liberators but once in power, forget them and become tyrants.
6. As an additional part of the Plan which we invoke, we assert that: the fields,
woodlands, and water which the haciendados [landlords], cientificos or bosses in
the shadow of tyranny and venal justice have usurped, will revert to the possession
of the towns or citizens who have their corresponding titles to these properties.
[These properties] have been usurped through the bad faith of our oppressors, who
maintained all along with arms in hand the above mentioned possession. The
usurpers who feel they have the right [to ownership], will demonstrate this before
special tribunals which will be established when the Revolution triumphs.
7. In virtue of the fact that the immense majority of the towns and Mexican citizens
are not masters of the soil they step upon, suffering horrors of misery without being
able to better their social condition at all nor dedicate themselves to industry or
agriculture because of the monopoly in a few hands of the land, woodlands, and
waters, for this reason [the lands] will be expropriated, with indemnity of the third
part of these monopolies to their powerful owners, so that the towns and citizens of
Mexico can obtain common lands [ejidos], colonies, and legitimate resources for
towns or agricultural fields and that above all the lack of prosperity and well-being
of the Mexican people is improved.
8. The haciendados, cientificos or bosses who oppose directly or indirectly the
present plan, will have their possessions nationalized and two thirds of what they
own will be destined for war indemnities, [and] pensions for the widows and
orphans of the victims who succumb in the fight for this plan.
9. To regulate the procedures in regard to the items mentioned above, the laws of
disentailment and nationalization will be applied as is appropriate. [The laws] put
into effect by the immortal Juarez regarding Church lands will serve as a guide and

example, which set a severe example to the despots and conservatives who at all
times have tried to impose the ignominious yoke of oppression and backwardness.
10. The insurgent military chiefs of the Republic, who rose up in armed revolt at the
behest of Francisco I. Madero to defend the plan of San Luis Potosi and who now
oppose by force the present Plan, are to be judged traitors to the cause they
defended and to the Fatherland, given the fact that in actuality many of them to

CHINA
China’s initial risings in 1911 led to the formal ending to the empire, in 1912, with a
document that expressed new political goals while concealing the actual
machinations that pushed the boy emperor to this point. This is followed by a fuller
statement by the would-be reform leader of the new regime, the Western-educated
Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925), who formed a new Nationalist Party but was unsuccessful
in wresting power from regional warlords during the early 1920s.

PROCLAMATION OF THE ABDICATION OF THE MANCHUS, 1912

“The Whole Country is tending towards a republican form of government. It is the
Will of Heaven, and it is certain that we could not reject the people’s desire for the
sake of one family’s honor and glory.”
“We, the Emperor, hand over the sovereignty to the people. We decide the form of
government to be a constitutional republic.”
“In this time of transition, in order to unite the South and the North, We appoint
Yuan Shi-kai to organize a provisional government, consulting the people’s army
regarding the union of the five peoples, Manuchus, Chinese, Mongolians,
Mohammedans, and Tibetans. These peoples jointly constitute the great State of
Chung Hwa Ming-Kus [a republic of China].

SUN YAT-SEN: FUNDAMENTALS OF NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION (1923 C.E.)
I Principles of Revolution

The term Kemin, or revolution, was first used by Confucius. Incidents of a
revolutionary nature repeatedly happened in Chinese history after Tang (founder of
the Shang Dynasty, 1766 B.C.E.) and Wu (founder of the Zhou Dynasty, 1122 B.C.E.). In
Europe revolutionary tides surged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and
they have since spread over the whole world. In due course they created republics,
and they conferred constitutions on monarchies. The principles that I have held in
promoting the Chinese revolution were in some cases copied from our traditional
ideals, in other cases modeled on European theory and experience, and in still others
formulated according to original and self- developed theories. They are described as
follows:
1. PRINCIPLE OF NATIONALISM

Revelations of Chinese history prove that the Chinese as a people are independent in
spirit and in conduct. Coerced into touch with other people, they could at times live
in peace with them by maintaining friendly relations and at others assimilate them
as the result of propinquity. During the periods when their political and military
prowess declined, they could not escape for the time from the fate of a conquered
nation, but they could eventually vigorously reassert themselves. Nationalistic ideas
in China did not come from a foreign source; they were inherited from our remote
forefathers. Upon this legacy is based my principle of nationalism, and where
necessary, I have developed it and amplified and improved upon it. No vengeance
has been inflicted on the Manchus and we have endeavored to live side by side with
them on an equal footing. This is our nationalistic policy toward races within our
national boundaries. Externally, we should strive to maintain independence in the
family of nations, and to spread our indigenous civilization as well as to enrich it by
absorbing what is best in world civilization, with the hope that we may forge ahead
with other nations towards the goal of ideal brotherhood.
2. PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY

In ancient China we had the Emporer Yao (2357–2258 B.C.E.) and Emperor Shun
(2258–2206 B.C.E) who departed from the hereditary system and chose their
successors. We also had Tang and Wu who over threw kingdoms by revolution.
Preserved in our books are such sayings as: “Heaven sees as the people see; Heaven
hears as the people hear.” “We have heard of a person name Zhou having been slain,
we have not heard of a monarch having been murdered.” “The people are most
important, while the king is of the least importance.” All these sayings ring with
democratic sentiments. Since we have had only ideas about popular rights, and no
democratic system has been evolved, we have to go to Europe and America for a
republican form of government.…
All through my revolutionary career I have held the view that China must be
made a republic. There are three reasons. First, from a theoretical point of view,
there is no ground for preserving a monarchical form of government, since it is
widely recognized that the people constitute the foundation of a nation and they are
all equal in their own country. In the second place, under Manchu occupation the
Chinese were forced into the position of the vanquished, and suffered oppression for
more than two hundred and sixty years. While a constitutional monarchy may not
arouse deep resentment in other countries and can maintain itself for the time being,
it will be an impossibility in China. This is from a historical point of view. A third

reason may be advanced with an eye on the future of the nation. That in China
prolonged periods of disorder usually followed a revolution was due to the desire of
every insurgent to be a king and to his subsequent contention for the throne. If a
republican government is adopted, there will be no contention. For these three
reasons, I have decided for the republican form of government in order to realize the
principle of democracy.
My second decision is that a constitution must be adopted to ensure good
government. The true meaning of constitutionalism was discovered by Montesquieu.
The threefold separation of the legislative, judicial, and executive powers as
advocated by him was accepted in every constitutional country in Europe.
3. PRINCIPLE OF LIVELIHOOD

With the invention of modern machines, the phenomenon of uneven distribution of
wealth in the West has become all the more marked. Intensified by crosscurrents,
economic revolution was flaring up more ferociously than political revolution. This
situation was scarcely noticed by our fellow-countrymen thirty years ago. On my
tour of Europe and America, I saw with my own eyes the instability of their
economic structure and the deep concern of their leaders in groping for a solution. I
felt that, although the disparity of wealth under our economic organization is not so
great as in the West, the difference is only in degree, not in character. The situation
will become more acute when the West extends its economic influence to China. We
must form plans beforehand in order to cope with the situation. After comparing
various schools of economic thought, I have come to the realization that the
principle of state ownership is most profound, reliable and practical. Moreover, it
will forestall in China difficulties which have already caused much anxiety in the
West. I have therefore decided to enforce the principle of the people’s livelihood
simultaneously with the principles of nationalism and democracy, with the hope to
achieve our political objective and nip economic unrest in the bud.
II Fundamentals of Revolution

According to my plan, the progress of our revolution should be regulated and
divided into three stages: First, military rule; second, political tutelage; third,
constitutional government. The first stage is a period of destruction, during which
military rule is installed. The revolutionary army is to break down (as it did)
Manchu despotism, sweep away official corruption, and reform vicious customs.
RUSSIA
This famous pamphlet was published in 1902, when Lenin’s Bolshevik wing of the
Communist movement was under police attack and very much out of power. It
suggests both the goals and the methods Lenin and his colleagues would use when
revolution came.
When Lenin tried to organize a Marxist revolutionary party in Russia, he faced a
dilemma. The ultimate goal was a disciplined party. He was irritated by the dissent
and controversy that raged in revolutionary circles. In this famous treatise he
outlined his ideas on freedom in powerful words that to later generations read like a
denunciation of freedom as it is normally understood. Implemented by Lenin himself
after the 1917 revolution and exacerbated by Stalin, they transformed Marx’s dream
of a “dictatorship of the proletariat” (absolute rule by the people, depriving the old
ruling class of its power) into its opposite, a dictatorship over the proletariat. In
later decades, the rationale for repression outlined here was advanced again and

again by dictatorial Communist governments as they argued that the small
“vanguard” of the proletariat was capable of leading the masses for their own good,
even in opposition to their express will. Why does he argue no criticism can be made
of socialist ideology?
•••
V. I. LENIN, WHAT IS TO BE DONE

“Freedom”—it’s a great word, but under the flag of “freedom of industry” the most
rapacious of wars were conducted. Under the banner of “freedom of labor” workers
have been robbed. The very same internal hypocrisy is contained in the
contemporary phrase “freedom to criticize.” People who are truly convinced that
they have advanced the frontier of science would not demand freedom for new ideas
to coexist next to old, but to replace them.…
We are walking in a small, tight group along a steep and difficult path, firmly
joining hands. We are surrounded by enemies, and must continue almost always
under their fire. We have freely and consciously decided to unite to fight the enemy.
…
We said that Social-Democratic consciousness could not exist among the workers.
But it could be brought to them from without. The history of all countries testifies
that workers left exclusively to their own strength can cultivate only a trade union
consciousness—that is the belief in the need to unite into a union, struggle against
the bosses, press the government to pass needed labor legislation, etc. The doctrine
of Socialism grew out of philosophic, historical, and economic theories which were
worked out by the educated representatives of the propertied class, the intelligentsia.
The founders of modern scientific socialism, Marx and Engels belonged themselves
to the bourgeois intelligentsia. Just as in Russia, the theoretical doctrine of SocialDemocracy arose quite independently from spontaneous growth of a workers
movement, but arose rather as a natural and inevitable result of the development of
ideas among the revolutionary socialist intelligentsia.…
Since there can be no talk of an independent ideology developed by the working
masses in the process of their movement, the only choice is: bourgeois or socialist
ideology. There is no middle way (for mankind has not developed any “third”
ideology), and generally speaking, in a society torn by class opposition there could
never be a non-class or an above-class ideology. Therefore any belittlement of
socialist ideology, any dismissal of it signified the strengthening of bourgeois
ideology.
A small, tight, solid nucleus of the most dependable, experienced and hardened
workers having trustworthy representatives in the main regions and connected by all
the rules of secrecy with the organization of revolutionaries can quite capably, with
the widest support of the masses and without any formal organization, fulfill all
functions of a professional organization, in a manner desirable to a SocialDemocratic movement.
LENIN’S CALL TO POWER, OCTOBER 24, 1917

When revolution broke out in Russia, Lenin was in exile in Switzerland. But the
German government facilitated his travel to Russia, hoping his agitation would
weaken the Russian war effort in World War I (an effort the first revolutionary
government, under the liberal Kerensky, attempted to continue). Lenin’s statement
accurately reflected the forceful moves he and the revolutionary workers’ soviets

would adopt in toppling the liberal regime and replacing it with Communist
leadership.
•••
The situation is critical in the extreme. In fact, it is now absolutely clear that to
delay the uprising would be fatal. With all my might I urge comrades to realize that
everything now hangs by a thread; that we are confronted by problems which are
not to be solved by conferences or congresses (even congresses of Soviets), but
exclusively by peoples, by the masses, by the struggle of the armed people.…
All districts, all regiments, all forces must be mobilized at once and must
immediately send their delegations to the Revolutionary Military Committee and to
the Central Committee of the Bolsheviks with the insistent demand that under no
circumstances should power be left in the hands of Kerensky and Co.…
… It would be an infinite crime on the part of the revolutionaries were they to let
the chance slip, knowing that the salvation of the revolution, the offer of peace, the
salvation of Petrograd [St. Petersburg], salvation from famine, the transfer of the
land to the peasants depend upon them.
The government is tottering. It must be given the death-blow at all costs.
THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF LAND SOCIALIZATION

This decree was one of the early moves of the new Bolshevik regime, ushering in a
huge social and economic change but also setting up a radical new system of
agricultural organization that would antagonize many peasants.
•••
Decree of the Central Executive Committee, February 19, 1918
PART I. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Article 1. All private ownership of land, minerals, waters, forests, and natural
resources within the boundaries of the Russian Federated Soviet Republic is
abolished forever.
Article 2. Henceforth all the land is handed over without compensation (open or
secret) to the toiling masses for their use.
Article 3. With the exceptions indicated in this decree the right to the use of the land
belongs to him who cultivates it with his own labor.
Article 4. The right to use of the land cannot be limited on account of sex, religion,
nationality, or citizenship.
Article 5. All minerals, forests, water, and other live forces of nature (depending on
their importance) are placed at the disposition of the uzed, gubernia, regional, or
federal Soviets to be controlled by them. The methods of utilizing and managing the
above resources will be determined by special decree.
Article 6. All privately owned live stock, agriculture implements, and buildings of
estates that are worked by hired labor shall be taken over by the land departments
of the [local and Soviet governments] without compensation.…
Article 11. In addition to effecting an equitable distribution of the agricultural land
among the toiling agricultural population and a more efficient utilization of the
national resources, the local and federal land departments have also the following
duties: (a) to create conditions favorable to the development of the productive
forces of the country by increasing the productivity of the soil, to develop scientific

farming, and to raise the general level of agricultural knowledge among the land
toilers; (b) to create a reserve of agricultural land; (c) to develop agricultural
enterprises such as horticulture, apiculture, market-gardening, stock raising,
dairying, etc.; (d) to hasten in certain areas the transition from a less productive to a
more productive system of land cultivation by effecting a better distribution of the
agricultural population; (e) to encourage the collective system of agriculture at the
expense of individual farming, the former being more economical and leading to
socialistic economy.

CHAPTER 29
AUTHORITARIANISM ON THE RIGHT
Italian Fascism, German Nazism, And Argentine Peronism
A new kind of authoritarianism was born in Europe at the end of the nineteenth
century. It built on strong nationalism but added a greater hostility to liberal ideas
and institutions. Authoritarians resented the divisions and bickering of
parliamentary systems. They disliked individualism and the consumer society,
believing that people should find a higher purpose in the nation and its state. Most
feared the rise of socialism, seeking to cure social ills by other, state-sponsored
means. Authoritarianism was a noisy but also a small force in Europe until the huge
disruptions of World War I. Then additional nationalist discontents, the fear of
Communism in Russia, and sheer confusion gave the authoritarian movements
additional support. First in Italy, then in other countries, the movements were able
to gain power, usually by legal means, though none ever obtained an outright
majority in any free election.
Authoritarianism also grew outside Europe. In Latin America many authoritarian
dictators had flourished at times during the nineteenth century; they were called
caudillos, the Spanish word for leader. Most authoritarians defended existing
institutions—property owners, the army, the church. They gained power because of
the difficulty of establishing stable governments after the independence wars earlier
in the century. Some caudillos added a populist twist, wooing elements of the
common people by programs of public works and state jobs. Authoritarianism
continued in the twentieth century, off and on, and it picked up some of the
trappings of European fascism, from grandiose principles of state power and
nationalism to the uniformed movements, whose members were taught to march in
military style, a tactic designed to whip up loyalty and discipline. Authoritarian
leaders sprang up in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia after World War II,
again in part because some newly independent states found it hard to generate
effective political institutions in any other way. Some of these leaders, too, took on
certain fascist overtones.
A comparison of European fascism and a significant adaptation of
authoritarianism in Latin America allows consideration of one of the vital political
currents of the twentieth century. Authoritarian movements, after the fascist
example, undoubtedly shared certain features and imitated each other, but they were
not all alike. Ideas varied, and contexts varied as well; a full Nazi-style state was
possible only in an industrialized society, for example. Even in Europe, Italian
fascism and German Nazism clearly differed, despite some shared causes and shared
impulses.
Mussolini’s movement came first, among the modern versions of authoritarianism;
Mussolini came into power in 1923. A former socialist, Mussolini developed a fascist
ideology amid the social strife and disappointed nationalism of post–World War I
Italy. Italian liberal democracy was a rather new creation, and it was not
functioning well.
Hitler, an ardent nationalist and anti-Semite and a disgruntled war veteran,
struggled through the 1920s. Many Germans deeply resented their loss in World War
I and the harsh peace imposed on their country. But Hitler got his chance only when

economic depression, in 1929, fueled the discontent; he came to power in 1933.
But by the late nineteenth century some Latin American Caudillos were
embellishing their dictatorships by working for greater economic development and
reaching out for more active popular support. Juan Peron was in this newer
tradition. When he came to power in 1946, he also had the example of European
fascism before him—Argentina was one of the more Europeanized Latin American
countries, with a large minority of Italian origin.
A key analytical problem, as sources from fascism, Nazism, and Peronism readily
attest, is that leaders of those movements were not interested in careful statements
of principle or even in complete consistency. They talked of subordinating the
individual to higher purposes, but they also praised human freedom. They were
hostile to Marxism, but they often talked about social justice and sometimes (as with
Peron) established themselves as friends of the working class in order to gain
extensive working-class support.
A final question must be applied to Mussolini, to Hitler, and to Peron alike: why
did they gain so much popularity? Do their ideas help explain the appeal of
authoritarian movements in many different countries from the 1920s onward?
Questions
1. Why was fascism opposed to socialism? to democracy? to liberalism? What was
the fascist alternative, according to Mussolini? What were the principles and goals
of a fascist state?
2. How did the fascist state contrast with the liberal idea of the state? What was the
fascist alternative to individualism?
3. What was Hitler’s definition of a folkish state? How do Hitler’s ideas show the
bases of the launching of World War II and the Holocaust?
4. What ideas did Mussolini and Hitler share concerning methods for their
movements? Did they have similar ideas about the state? Did Mussolini anticipate
Hitler’s ideas of a folkish state?
5. Why did Hitler, Mussolini, and Peron all claim to be revolutionary?
6. How do Mussolini, Hitler, and Peron suggest some of the political and social
problems that gave rise to their movements?
7. How did Peron learn what not to say, from the fates and international reputations
of Italian and German fascism?
8. How did Peron’s ideas of the nation compare with Hitler’s? How did his idea of
individualism compare with the fascist approach? Judging by his stated goals, is it
useful to think of Peron as a fascist? as a Nazi?
9. How did Peron distinguish himself from traditional Latin American caudillos?
10. If Peron should not be called a fascist, how are his political movement and beliefs
best described?
For Further Discussion
1. Why might elements of European fascism prove attractive in the Latin American
political context after World War II?
2. Why was it unlikely that a leader like Peron could set up a full Nazi state?
3. What was the relationship between fascistlike movements and nationalism? What
kinds of nationalism avoided some kind of fascist outgrowth, and why?

4. Do conditions for fascism still exist in the world today? What societies, currently,
would seem the most likely potential centers of serious fascist movements?
ITALIAN FASCISM: MUSSOLINI
Mussolini (1883–1945) came to power in 1923, following a famous “march on
Rome” when armed bands (Squadriste), which had been violently disrupting
democratic political meetings, mounted a largely peaceful, symbolic protest surge on
the national capital. Mussolini spelled out his fascist doctrine (the name fascist came
from the movement’s symbol, a bundle or fascio) at various points in his career. The
following selection comes from a 1932 article, “Doctrine of Fascism,” written at a
time when he was already well established as dictator. During the 1920s Mussolini
had suppressed political opposition and had developed extensive public works
projects, while dismantling the previous liberal state and turning parliament into a
rubber stamp. Mussolini was toppled by the allied invasion of Italy during World
War II and killed by resistance fighters.
From Benito Mussolini, The Political and Social Doctrine of Fascism, trans. Jane
Soames (London: Hogarth Press, 1933), 8–14, 16–26.
•••
Fascism was not the nursling of a doctrine worked out beforehand with detailed
elaboration; it was born of the need for action and was itself from the beginning
practical rather than theoretical; it was not merely another political party but, even
in the first two years, in opposition to all political parties as such, and itself a living
movement. The name which I then (1919) gave the organization fixed its character.
And yet, if one were to re-read, in the now dusty columns of that date, the report of
the meeting in which the Fasci Italiani di combattimento were constituted, one
would there find no ordered expression of doctrine, but a series of aphorisms,
anticipations and aspirations which, when refined by time from the original ore,
were destined after some years to develop into an ordered series of doctrinal
concepts, forming the Fascist political doctrine—different from all others either of
the past or the present day.…
The years which preceded the march to Rome were years of great difficulty,
during which the necessity for action did not permit of research or any complete
elaboration of doctrine. The battle had to be fought in the towns and villages. There
was much discussion, but—what was more important and more sacred—men died.
They knew how to die. Doctrine, beautifully defined and carefully elucidated…
might be lacking; but there was to take its place something more decisive—Faith.
Even so, anyone… will find that the fundamentals of doctrine were cast during the
years of conflict. It was precisely in those years that Fascist thought armed itself,
was refined, and began the great task of organization. The problem of the relation
between the individual citizen and the State; the allied problems of authority and
liberty; political and social problems as well as those specifically national—a
solution was being sought for all these while at the same time the struggle against
Liberalism, Democracy, Socialism and the Masonic bodies was being carried on.…
And above all, Fascism… believes neither in the possibility nor the utility of
perpetual peace. It thus repudiates the doctrine of Pacifism—born of a renunciation
of the struggle and an act of cowardice in the face of sacrifice. War alone brings up
to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the
peoples who have the courage to meet it.… This anti-Pacifist spirit is carried by
Fascism even into the life of the individual; the proud motto of the Squadrista, “Me

ne frego” [“We don’t give a damn”]…is an act of philosophy not only stoic, the
summary of a doctrine not only political—it is the education to combat, the
acceptation of the risks which combat implies, and a new way of life for Italy. Thus
the Fascist accepts life and loves it, knowing nothing of and despising suicide: he
rather conceives of life as a duty and struggle and conquest, life which should be
high and full, lived for oneself, but above all for others.…
Such a conception of life makes Fascism the complete opposition of that doctrine,
the base of so-called scientific and Marxian Socialism, the materialist conception of
history; according to which the history of human civilization can be explained
simply through the conflict of interests among the various social groups and by the
change and development in the means and instruments of production. … Fascism,
now and always, believes in holiness and in heroism; that is to say, in actions
influenced by no economic motive, direct or indirect. … It follows that the existence
of an unchangeable and unchanging class-war is also denied—the natural progeny of
the economic conception of history. And above all Fascism denies that classwar can
be the preponderant force in the transformation of society. These two fundamental
concepts of Socialism being thus refuted, nothing is left of it but the sentimental
aspiration … towards a social convention in which the sorrows and sufferings of the
humblest shall be alleviated. … Fascism denies the validity of the equation, wellbeing=happiness, which would reduce men to the level of animals, caring for one
thing only—to be fat and well-fed—and would thus degrade humanity to a purely
physical existence.
After Socialism, Fascism combats the whole complex system of democratic
ideology, and repudiates it, whether in its theoretical premises or in its practical
application. Fascism denies that the majority, by the simple fact that it is a majority,
can direct human society; it denies that numbers alone can govern by means of a
periodical consultation, and it affirms the immutable, beneficial and fruitful
inequality of mankind, which can never be permanently leveled through the mere
operation of a mechanical process such as universal suffrage. The democratic regime
may be defined as from time to time giving the people the illusion of sovereignty,
while the real effective sovereignty lies in the hands of other concealed and
irresponsible forces.…
Fascism has taken up an attitude of complete opposition to the doctrines of
Liberalism, both in the political field and the field of economics.… Liberalism only
flourished for half a century.…
The foundation of Fascism is the conception of the State, its character, its duty,
and its aim. Fascism conceives of the State as an absolute, in comparison with which
all individuals or groups are relative, only to be conceived of in their relation to the
State. The conception of the Liberal State is not that of a directing force, guiding the
play and development, both material and spiritual, of a collective body, but merely
a force limited to the function of recording results: on the other hand, the Fascist
State is itself conscious, and has itself a will and a personality—thus it may be called
the “ethic” State. In 1929… I said:
“For us Fascists, the State is not merely a guardian… nor is it an organization
with purely material aims. … Nor is it a purely political creation. … The State, as
conceived of and as created by Fascism, is a spiritual and moral fact in itself, since
its political, juridical and economic organization of the nation is a concrete thing;
and such an organization must be in its origins and development a manifestation of
the spirit. The State is the guarantor of security both internal and external, but it is

also the custodian and transmitter of the spirit of the people, as it has grown up
through the centuries in language, in customs and in faith. And the State is not only
a living reality of the present, it is also linked with the past and above all with the
future, and thus transcending the brief limits of individual life, it represents the
immanent spirit of the nation.…”
From 1929 until today [1932], evolution, both political and economic, has
everywhere gone to prove the validity of these doctrinal premises. Of such gigantic
importance is the State. It is the force which alone can provide a solution to the
dramatic contradictions of capitalism, and that state of affairs which we call the
crisis can only be dealt with by the State, as between other States. … Yet the Fascist
State is unique, and an original creation. It is not reactionary, but revolutionary, in
that it anticipates the solution of the universal political problems which elsewhere
have to be settled in the political field by the rivalry of parties, the excessive power
of the Parliamentary regime and the irresponsibility of political assemblies; while it
meets the problems of the economic field by a system of syndicalism* which is
continually increasing in importance, as much in the sphere of labour as of industry:
and in the moral field enforces order, discipline, and obedience to that which is the
determined moral code of the country. Fascism desires the State to be a strong and
organic body, at the same time reposing upon broad and popular support. The
Fascist State has drawn into itself even the economic activities of the nation, and,
through the corporative social and educational institutions created by it, its
influence reaches every aspect of the national life and includes, framed in their
respective organizations, all the political, economic and spiritual forces of the
nation. A State which reposes upon the support of millions of individuals who
recognize its authority, are continually conscious of its power and are ready at once
to serve it, is not the old tyrannical State. … The individual in the Fascist State is not
annulled but rather multiplied, just in the same way that a soldier in a regiment is
not diminished but rather increased by the number of his comrades. The Fascist
State organizes the nation, but leaves a sufficient margin of liberty to the individual;
the latter is deprived of all useless and possibly harmful freedom, but retains what is
essential; the deciding power in the question cannot be the individual, but the State
alone.…
According to Fascism, government is not so much a thing to be expressed in
territorial or military terms as in terms of morality and the spirit. It must be thought
of as an Empire—that is to say, a nation which directly or indirectly rules other
nations, without the need for conquering a single square yard of territory. For
Fascism, the growth of Empire, that is to say the expansion of the nation, is an
essential manifestation of vitality, and its opposite a sign of decadence. Peoples
which are rising, or rising again after a period of decadence, are always imperialist;
any renunciation is a sign of decay and death. Fascism is the doctrine best adapted
to represent the tendencies and the aspirations of a people, like the people of Italy,
who are rising again after many centuries of abasement and foreign servitude. But
Empire demands discipline, the co-ordination of all forces and a deeply-felt sense of
duty and sacrifice: this fact explains … the necessarily severe measures which must
be taken against those who would oppose this spontaneous and inevitable movement
of Italy in the twentieth century.
*Mussolini meant this as an alternative to class-based unions. He installed statedominated employer-worker boards, outlawing other unions and strikes.
GERMAN NAZISM: HITLER

The following passage comes from Hitler’s Mein Kampf, which outlined his goals for
a Nazi state with suprising frankness. Hitler wrote the book after he was jailed for
an attempted revolt in a Munich beer hall in 1923. He was released in less than a
year and resumed his propaganda activities, though his movement was foundering
until the Depression hit Germany at the end of the decade. Then, votes for Nazism
began to soar, reaching more than a third of the total in a 1932 election. Once he
was in power in 1933, Hitler constructed a dictatorship; actively promoted
economic development, particularly toward building up German armaments;
attacked and ultimately killed most Jews in Germany and Europe (the Holocaust);
and launched a series of aggressive moves that led to World War II, committing
suicide in 1945 as Soviet armies invaded Berlin.
•••
For the realization of philosophical ideals and of the demands derived from them no
more occurs through men’s pure feeling or inner will in themselves than the
achievement of freedom through the general longing for it. No, only when the ideal
urge for independence gets a fighting organization in the form of military
instruments of power can the pressing desire of a people be transformed into
glorious reality.
Every philosophy of life, even if it is a thousand times correct and of highest
benefit to humanity, will remain without significance for the practical shaping of a
people’s life, as long as its principles have not become the banner of a fighting
movement which for its part in turn will be a party as long as its activity has not
found completion in the victory of its ideas and its party dogmas have not become
the new state principles of a people’s community.…
This transformation of a general, philosophical, ideal conception of the highest
truth into a definitely delimited, tightly organized political community of faith and
struggle, unified in spirit and will, is the most significant achievement, since on its
happy solution alone the possibility of the victory of an idea depends. From the
army of often millions of men, who as individuals more or less clearly and definitely
sense these truths, and in part perhaps comprehend them, one man must step
forward who with apodictic force will form granite principles from the wavering
idea-world of the broad masses and take up the struggle for their sole correctness,
until from the shifting waves of a free thought-world there will arise a brazen cliff of
solid unity in faith and will.

The general right for such an activity is based on necessity, the personal right on
success.…
What has been profitably Germanized in history is the soil which our ancestors
acquired by the sword and settled with German peasants. In so far as they directed
foreign blood into our national body in this process, they contributed to that
catastrophic splintering of our inner being which is expressed in German superindividualism—a phenomenon, I am sorry to say, which is praised in many quarters.
…
… [T]he state must, therefore, in the light of reason, regard its highest task as the
preservation and intensification of the race, this fundamental condition of all human
cultural development.
It was the Jew, Karl Marx, who was able to draw the extreme inference from

those false conceptions and views concerning the nature and purpose of a state: by
detaching the state concept from racial obligations without being able to arrive at
any other equally acknowledged formulation, the bourgeois world even paved the
way for a doctrine which denies the state as such.…
It is, therefore, the first obligation of a new movement, standing on the ground of
a folkish world view, to make sure that its conception of the nature and purpose of
the state attains a uniform and clear character.
Thus the basic realization is: that the state represents no end, but a means. It is, to
be sure, the premise for the formation of a higher human culture, but not its cause,
which lies exclusively in the existence of a race capable of culture. Hundreds of
exemplary states might exist on earth, but if the Aryan* culture-bearer died out,
there would be no culture corresponding to the spiritual level of the highest peoples
of today. We can go even farther and say that the fact of human state formation
would not in the least exclude the possibility of the destruction of the human race,
provided that superior intellectual ability and elasticity would be lost due to the
absence of their racial bearers.…
The state in itself does not create a specific cultural level; it can only preserve the
race which conditions this level. Otherwise the state as such may continue to exist
unchanged for centuries while, in consequence of a racial mixture which it has not
prevented, the cultural capacity of a people and the general aspect of its life
conditioned by it have long since suffered a profound change. The present-day state,
for example, may very well simulate its existence as a formal mechanism for a
certain length of time, but the racial poisoning of our national body creates a
cultural decline which even now is terrifyingly manifest.
*Hitler used the term Aryan to designate the Germanic “race.”
Thus, the precondition for the existence of a higher humanity is not the state, but
the nation possessing the necessary ability.…
The state is a means to an end. Its end lies in the preservation and advancement
of a community of physically and psychically homogeneous creatures. This
preservation itself comprises first of all existence as a race and thereby permits the
free development of all the forces dormant in this race. Of them a part will always
primarily serve the preservation of physical life, and only the remaining part the
promotion of a further spiritual development. Actually the one always creates the
precondition for the other.
States which do not serve this purpose are misbegotten, monstrosities in fact. The
fact of their existence changes this no more than the success of a gang of bandits can
justify robbery.
We National Socialists as champions of a new philosophy of life must never base
ourselves on so-called ‘accepted facts’—and false ones at that. If we did, we would
not be the champions of a new great idea, but the coolies of the present-day lie. We
must distinguish in the sharpest way between the state as a vessel and the race as its
content. This vessel has meaning only if it can preserve and protect the content;
otherwise it is useless.
Thus, the highest purpose of a folkish state is concern for the preservation of
those original racial elements which bestow culture and create the beauty and
dignity of a higher mankind. We, as Aryans, can conceive of the state only as the
living organism of a nationality which not only assures the preservation of this
nationality, but by the development of its spiritual and ideal abilities leads it to the

highest freedom.
But what they try to palm off on us as a state today is usually nothing but a
monstrosity born of deepest human error, with untold misery as a consequence.
We National Socialists know that with this conception we stand as revolutionaries
in the world of today and are also branded as such. But our thoughts and actions
must in no way be determined by the approval or disapproval of our time, but by
the binding obligation to a truth which we have recognized. Then we may be
convinced that the higher insight of posterity will not only understand our actions of
today, but will also confirm their correctness and exalt them.…
A state can be designated as exemplary if it is not only compatible with the living
conditions of the nationality it is intended to represent, but if in practice it keeps
this nationality alive by its own very existence—quite regardless of the importance
of this state formation within the framework of the outside world. For the function
of the state is not to create abilities, but only to open the road for those forces
which are present. Thus, conversely, a state can be designated as bad if, despite a
high cultural level, it dooms the bearer of this culture in his racial composition. For
thus it destroys to all intents and purposes the premise for the survival of this
culture which it did not create, but which is the fruit of a culture-creating
nationality safeguarded by a living integration through the state. The state does not
represent the content, but a form. A people’s cultural level at any time does not,
therefore, provide a standard for measuring the quality of the state in which it lives.
It is easily understandable that a people highly endowed with culture offers a more
valuable picture than a Negro tribe; nevertheless, the state organism of the former,
viewed according to its fulfillment of purpose, can be inferior to that of the Negro.
Though the best state and the best state form are not able to extract from a people
abilities which are simply lacking and never did exist, a bad state is assuredly able to
kill originally existing abilities by permitting or even promoting the destruction of
the racial culture-bearer.
Hence our judgment concerning the quality of a state can primarily be
determined only by the relative utility it possesses for a definite nationality, and in
no event by the intrinsic importance attributable to it in the world.…
If, therefore, we speak of a higher mission of the state, we must not forget that
the higher mission lies essentially in the nationality whose free development the
state must merely make possible by the organic force of its being.
ARGENTINA: PERONISM
The following materials are excerpts from speeches given by the Argentine dictator
between 1946 and 1949, when he was head of state. Peron (1896–1973) entered the
Argentine government as a result of a coup in 1943 and became president in 1946.
Developing an ardent following, particularly among urban workers, he launched
extensive building projects and welfare programs. He was ousted in 1956, returning
briefly thereafter, but a Peronist political movement remained an important force in
Argentine politics for some time.
•••
1. 1946
The Argentine Republic was born as a country of peace and work, endowed by
nature with everything people may hope for to live happily and in peace; on this

fact our international policy is based, we are inevitably heading for prosperity and
greatness achieved partly by reason of our geographical situation and by our
historical destiny.
There is nothing we can envy others, since God gave us whatever we may wish
for. Our policy is born of this aspect of our own natural greatness. We can never
seek to take something from someone since we are surrounded on this earth by
countries less fortunate than ours. For this reason, our international policy is a
policy of peace, friendship, and the desire to trade honestly and freely, whenever we
are offered the same freedom we grant, for in a world where absolute freedom of
trade does not exist, it would be suicidal to profess this absolute liberty.
From Juan Peron, The Voice of Peron (Buenos Aires: Argentine Government, 1950),
22, 36–37, 59, 64, 69–70, 71, 94, 110–11.
2. 1946
Social conscience has banished for ever the selfish individualism that looked only for
personal advantages, to seek the welfare of all through the collective action of
unions. Without that social conscience modern peoples are driven to struggle and
despair dragging their country to misery, war and distress.
This magnificent spectacle of the awakening of a social conscience is condemned
by men maintaining old standards, but they must not be blamed for they are the
product of an unhappy era already surpassed by the Argentine Republic. They are
the product of that individualistic and selfish age. They were born when gold was
the only thing that mattered, when gold was handled without consulting the heart
and therefore without understanding and realising that gold is not everything on this
earth, that dividends are not of paramount importance.
3. 1946
The Five-Year Plan, as we have drawn it up, is simply the result of a careful study of
all the Argentine problems, in the institutional order, in the field of national
defence, and also in the field of national economy. We have considered each of these
Argentine problems in detail, trying to discover their roots in order to find an
adequate solution.
Only a plan of vast proportions is in keeping with a great nation such as the
Argentine Republic. The mediocre, those who lack courage and faith, always prefer
small plans. Great nations, such as our own, with lofty ambitions and aspirations,
must also envisage great plans. Nothing valuable can be achieved by planning
trivialities.
4. 1946
Nowadays policy has changed: each person is at his post, working for the common
patrimony. When something is achieved, it must benefit everyone; when suffering
awaits us, all must share the sorrow. But let us advise those who still uphold ideas of
the old politicians that today, Argentine men and Argentine women are aware of the
existence of a movement supported by the whole country; that we all work and
struggle for this joint movement; therefore, that any personal or group policy will be
destroyed by us and also that our policy originates in this movement of union.
5. 1947

Encouraged by an overwhelming spirit of patriotism and steadily following the
principles and standards of conduct set by precedent, an officer must apply all his
strength of character and bring into play all his stalwart personality so that
whatever may be the circumstances in which they find themselves, the Armed Forces
will never cease to be an orderly and disciplined institution at the exclusive service
of the Nation. He must be sure that they are never transformed into a constant
danger which undervalues and hampers the will of a sovereign people.
6. 1948
To guide the masses one must first instruct and educate them, which can be done at
meetings or at lectures on politics, to be given in our centres, not to tell them to
vote for us, or that they must do this or that so that Peter or James will be elected to
represent them. No, we must speak to them of what are their obligations, because in
our country there is much talk of rights and little of moral obligations. We must talk
somewhat more about the obligations of each citizen towards his country and
towards his fellow countrymen, and forget for a time their rights since we have
mentioned them often enough.
7. 1949
The Peronistic doctrine has to go forward with its fundamental idea; to free the
people to prepare them to make the right use of this freedom. Neither can any
Argentine, and still less a Peronist, use unfairly the individual freedom which the
Magna Charter of the Republic offers him as a man of honour and not as a criminal.
A Peronist must be a slave to the law because that is the only way in which he can
eventually obtain his freedom. But it is not enough for a Peronist to be a slave of the
law. He must also observe the Peronist code of ethics, because those who break laws
are not the only criminals, those who abuse their freedom and who break the
community laws of the land they live in to the detriment of their fellow beings, are
also guilty.
8. 1949
Liberal Democracy, flexible in matters of political or economic retrocession, or
apparent discretion, was not equally flexible where social problems were concerned.
And the bourgeoisie after breaking their lines, have presented the spectacle of
peoples who all rise at once so as to measure the might of their presence, the volume
of their clamour, and the fairness of their claims. Popular expectation is followed by
discontent. Hope placed in the power of law is transformed into resentment if these
laws tolerate injustice. The State looks on impotently at a growing loss of prestige.
Its institutions prevent it from taking adequate measures and there are signs of a
divorce between its interpretation and that of the nation which it professes to
represent. Having lost prestige it becomes ineffectual, and is threatened by rebellion,
because if society does not find in the ruling powers the instrument with which to
achieve its happiness it will devise in its unprotected state, the instrument with
which to overthrow them.
9. 1949
The ambition for social progress has nothing to do with its noisy partisan
exploitation, neither can it be achieved by reviling and lowering the different types
of men. Mankind needs faith in his destiny and in what he is doing and to possess
sufficient insight to realise that the transition from the “I” to the “we” does not take

place in a flash as the extermination of the individual, but as a renewed avowal of
the existence of the individual functioning in the community. In that way the
phenomenon is orderly and takes place during the years in the form of a necessary
evolution which is more in the nature of “coming of age” than that of a mutiny.
11. 1949
The “caudillo” [name given to South American autocratic political leaders]
improvises while the statesman makes plans and carries them out. The “caudillo” has
no initiative, the statesman is creative. The “caudillo” is only concerned with
measures which are applicable to the reigning circumstances whereas the statesman
plans for all time; the deeds of the “caudillo” die with him, but the statesman lives
on in his handiwork. For that reason the “caudillo” has no guiding principles or
clear-cut plan while the statesman works methodically, defeating time and
perpetuating himself in his own creations. “Caudillismo” is a trade, but statecraft is
an art.
12. 1949
The politician of the old school made posts and favouritism a question of politics,
because as he achieved nothing of general usefulness, he had at least to win the good
will of those who would support him in the field of politics. The natural
consequences of this nepotism were political cliques; one politician dominated one
clique and another a different one. They fought among themselves until one of the
cliques came out on top and from them emerged the general staff bent not on
fulfilling their public office with self-denial and sacrifice, but on making the most of
their position to use the Nation as a huge body at the service of their own interests
and to throw away the wealth of the country with [no] sense of order and the fitness
of things.…
13. 1949
The revolutionary idea would not have been able to materialise along constitutional
lines if it had not been able to withstand the criticism, the violent attacks and even
the strain on principles when they run up against the rocks which appear, every day,
in the path of a ruler. The principles of the revolution would not have been able to
be upheld if they had not been the true reflection of Argentine sentiments.
The guiding principles of our movement must have made a very deep impression
on the national conscience for the people in the last elections to have consecrated
them by giving us full power to make reforms.

CHAPTER 30
DROPPING THE ATOMIC BOMB ON JAPAN
On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, killing
eighty thousand people and injuring and sickening many more; three days later it
unleashed another, on Nagasaki, which killed ninety thousand (including later
deaths from radiation sickness). Japan surrendered the next day.
This chapter deals with issues surrounding the atomic bomb. Bombing Japan not
only hastened the end of World War II. It also opened a new age of military
technology, which would steadily escalate during the Cold War. The threats and
fears associated with atomic weaponry have been part of world experience ever
since 1945. In the selections that follow, two sets of comparisons are offered: first, a
comparison of the tenor of the American decision to drop the bomb with Japanese
reactions; second, a comparison of historical memory, of how groups in the United
States and Japan still disputed the interpretation of what happened, fifty years after
the event. The second comparison is based on a summary of a bitter dispute about
historical presentation in the United States, at the national museum complex, the
Smithsonian.
American scientists were not unanimous in recommending dropping the bomb:
some urged a demonstration first to give Japan a chance to surrender. But there
were few bombs available, and the decision to act directly reflected an eagerness to
end the war, the desire to punish Japanese intransigence, and a new concern about
Russian intervention in the area. The first two documents suggest American attitudes
—first, those of President Truman, who made the decision, and second, those
revealed in the description of the Hiroshima mission by the pilot of the decisive
plane, the super fortress Enola Gay. What kinds of attitudes are suggested about the
bomb itself and about the Japanese? How did these two Americans relate themselves
to one of the great events of contemporary history? A third passage, by a doctor in
Nagasaki, recounts the experience of being bombed. Needless to say, from a
comparative standpoint, the three documents together show the huge differences in
perspective between people who do the bombing and people on the receiving end of
an unprecedented technological experience. (This comparison deserves consideration
in terms of another event-based, two-sided comparison, the one that deals with the
Opium War, in chapter 20.)
Following World War II, of course, the United States developed its nuclear
weaponry further, as fears of the Soviet Union increased and several other powers
joined the nuclear arms race. Japan, under American occupation but also
profoundly affected by the war itself, abandoned significant military activity and did
not participate in the weapons buildup.
The second set of comparative issues requires more subtle analysis. An article by
an American scholar recounts the bitter divisions that arose in the United States in
1995 over a proposed Smithsonian Institution commemoration of the bomb’s
anniversary. The planned Enola Gay exhibit presented American historians’ current
understanding of the complexity of the event, in light of what was known by then
about motives and alternatives. This complex rendering (with which the author of
the article clearly agrees) aroused massive hostility from veterans’ groups and a
growing conservative-nationalist sentiment in Congress at the time. The exhibit was

replaced with a simpler narrative, about the Enola Gay itself. Japan protested this
version because it clashed with its own complex memories. Historical memory is an
active ingredient in the life of any society, and it is almost always composed of a
mixture of selected facts and myths. After World War II most Americans were eager
to see former opponents confront their “real” war history. The Germans should teach
about the evils of Nazism; the Japanese should teach about their wartime atrocities,
including mistreatment of many prisoners. Neither nation moved as far along as
some observers thought they should, because nationalist traditions and the task of
rebuilding an undeniably different political structure made confronting too much
pain too difficult. But some Japanese, even in official life, did acknowledge some of
the wartime responsibilities. The United States has its own set of historical memory
issues (not just concerning the war) as it teaches its national history. Is the dropping
of the atomic bomb something Americans should probe more deeply, in order to
understand themselves?
Questions
1. What were President Truman’s motives in deciding to use the bomb? Did he
understand its potential? How did Truman’s note suggest he was justifying his
decision to himself?
2. What kinds of attitudes does the Tibbets note suggest? What were Tibbets’s
feelings about his unprecedented mission and its results? Would he and Truman
have agreed about the way to approach the use of the bomb? What are the best
arguments today for defending Truman’s policy and Tibbets’s participation? What
are the leading questions about the policy?
3. How do Tibbets’s and Akizuki’s descriptions of the bomb’s impact compare? How
do the two accounts prepare for the different (American and Japanese) historical
memories John Dower describes?
4. Do you think the Smithsonian was right to withdraw the original exhibit?
5. What kind of historical memory did John Dower think we should have? Why did
he feel that rosy memories about World War II remain so important in the United
States?
6. What attitudes toward Japan were involved in dropping the bomb? Are any
remnants of those feelings still active now in the United States?
7. What kind of historical memory of the bomb do most Japanese seek? Why did
they protest the simpler Smithsonian exhibit that replaced the controversial
display?
8. What are the main disputes over how to remember the bombing, within each
country (United States and Japan) and between them?
For Further Discussion
1. Was dropping the bomb a “war crime”?
2. Did the atomic bomb change the nature of modern war and diplomacy?
3. Why did the bomb experience have such different impacts in the United States
and Japan?
4. Why both the American and the Japanese versions of remembering the bomb
seem so important to citizens of the two nations, so long after the fact?
5. What kind of bomb “memory” works for you, and why?

DROPPING THE BOMB: TRUMAN, TIBBETS, AND AKIZUKI
The following three selections surround the immediate experience of the bomb, in
1945. Harry Truman was the thirty-third president of the United States, assuming
office after the death of Franklin Roosevelt in April 1945. When he took office,
Truman was immediately confronted with basic military and foreign policy issues as
World War II drew to a close. Decisions about the bomb, developed after five years
of crash research, were paramount among these issues. Truman here writes at the
Potsdam Conference—the last conference among the allies, including Stalin of the
Soviet Union and Churchill of Britain—which dealt with conditions of the postwar
world. Tensions between Stalin and the Western powers ran high at Potsdam.
Col. Paul Tibbets was an experienced pilot in the U.S. Army Air Force (the Air
Force had not yet become a separate military branch). He was twenty-nine when he
piloted the Enola Gay. Later, he frequently defended his action and refuted rumors
that he had suffered mental illness as a result of remorse. In 1995 he argued that he
had never had any doubts about his action and that it had saved lives by hastening
the end of the war. Earlier, in 1976, he had caused controversy by recreating the
attack in a Texas airshow complete with mushroom cloud; Japanese bomb survivors
protested this act as callous.
Dr. Tatsuichiro Akizuki practiced medicine in Nagasaki. He described his
experiences after learning about the earlier bomb in Hiroshima and then after the
second bomb was dropped on his own city. His recollections were extremely unusual
because there were so few survivors, though the doctor himself lived a number of
years after the attack.

HARRY TRUMAN

Diary: Potsdam 25 July 1945
We met at eleven today. That is Stalin, Churchill, and the US President. But I had a
most important session with Lord Mountbatten and General Marshall before that.
We have discovered the most terrible bomb in the history of the world. It may be the
fire destruction prophesied in the Euphrates Valley Era, after Noah and his fabulous
Ark.
Anyway we ‘think’ we have found the way to cause a disintegration of the atom.
An experiment in the New Mexican desert was startling—to put it mildly. Thirteen
pounds of the explosive caused the complete disintegration of a steel tower 60 feet
high, created a crater 6 feet deep and 1,200 feet in diameter, knocked over a steel
tower 1/2 mile away and knocked men down 10,000 yards away. The explosion was
visible for more than 200 miles and audible for 40 miles and more.
This weapon is to be used against Japan between now and August 10th. I have
told the Sec. of War, Mr Stimson, to use it so that military objectives and soldiers
and sailors are the target and not women and children. Even if the Japs are savages,
ruthless, merciless and fanatic, we as the leader of the world for the common
welfare cannot drop this terrible bomb on the old capital or the new.
He and I are in accord. The target will be a purely military one and we will issue
a warning statement asking the Japs to surrender and save lives. I’m sure they will
not do that, but we will have given them the chance. It is certainly a good thing for
the world that Hitler’s crowd or Stalin’s did not discover this atomic bomb. It seems
to be the most terrible thing ever discovered, but it can be made the most useful.

[The following day, 26 July, the Allies called upon Japan to surrender. The
alternative they said was ‘prompt and utter destruction.’ Japan did not surrender.]

COL. PAUL TIBBETS, USAAF PILOT OF THE BOMB-CARRYING PLANE

Up to this point it was common practice in any theatre of war to fly straight ahead,
fly level, drop your bombs, and keep right on going, because you could bomb
several thousands of feet in the air and you could cross the top of the place that you
had bombed with no concern whatsoever. But it was determined by the scientists
that, in order to escape and maintain the integrity of the aircraft and the crew, that
this aeroplane could not fly forward after it had dropped the bomb. It had to turn
around and get away from that bomb as fast as it could. If you placed this aeroplane
in a very steep angle of bank to make this turn, if you turned 158 degrees from the
direction that you were going, you would then begin to place distance between
yourself and that point of explosion as quickly as possible. You had to get away
from the shock wave that would be coming back from the ground in the form of an
ever expanding circle as it came upwards. It’s necessary to make this turn to get
yourself as far as possible from an expanding ring and 158 degrees happened to be
the turn for that particular circle. It was difficult. It was something that was not
done with a big bomber aeroplane. You didn’t make this kind of a steep turn—you
might almost call it an acrobatic manoeuvre—and the big aircraft didn’t do these
things. However, we refined it, we learned how to do it. It had been decided earlier
that there was a possibility that an accident could occur on take-off, and so
therefore we would not arm this weapon until we had left the runway and were out
to sea. This of course meant that had there been an accident there would have been
an explosion from normal powder charges but there would not have been a nuclear
explosion. As I said this worried more people than it worried me because I had
plenty of faith in my aeroplane. I knew my engines were good. We started our takeoff on time which was somewhere about two-forty-five I think, and the aeroplane
went on down the runway. It was loaded quite heavily but it responded exactly like I
had anticipated it would. I had flown this aeroplane the same way before and there
was no problem and there was nothing different this night in the way we went. We
arrived over the initial point and started in on the bomb run which had about eleven
minutes to go, rather a long type of run for a bomb but on the other hand we felt we
needed this extra time in straight and level flight to stabilize the air speed of the
aeroplane, to get everything right down to the last-minute detail. As I indicated
earlier the problem after the release of the bomb is not to proceed forward but to
turn away. As soon as the weight had left the aeroplane I immediately went into this
steep turn and we tried then to place distance between ourselves and the point of
impact. In this particular case that bomb took fifty-three seconds from the time it
left the aeroplane until it exploded and this gave us adequate time of course to make
the turn. We had just made the turn and rolled out on level flight when it seemed
like somebody had grabbed a hold of my aeroplane and gave it a real hard shaking
because this was the shock wave that had come up. Now after we had been hit by a
second shock wave not quite so strong as the first one I decided we’ll turn around
and go back and take a look. The day was clear when we dropped that bomb, it was
a clear sunshiny day and the visibility was unrestricted. As we came back around
again facing the direction of Hiroshima we saw this cloud coming up. The cloud by

this time, now two minutes old, was up at our altitude. We were 33,000 feet at this
time and the cloud was up there and continuing to go right on up in a boiling
fashion, as if it was rolling and boiling. The surface was nothing but a black boiling,
like a barrel of tar. Where before there had been a city with distinctive houses,
buildings and everything that you could see from our altitude, now you couldn’t see
anything except a black boiling debris down below.

DR. TATSUICHIRO AKIZUKI

During the morning Mr Yokota turned up to see his daughter, who was one of our
in-patients. He lived at the foot of Motohara Hill, and was an engineer in the
research department of the Mitsubishi Ordnance Factory, then one of the centres of
armament manufacture in Japan. The torpedoes used in the attack on Pearl Harbor
had been made there. Mr Yokota always had something interesting to say. He used
to visit me now and again, often passing on some new piece of scientific
information.
He said: ‘I hear Hiroshima was very badly damaged on the sixth.’
Together we despaired over the destiny of Japan, he as an engineer, I as a doctor.
Then he said gloomily: ‘I don’t think the explosion was caused by any form of
chemical energy.’
‘What then?’ I inquired, eager to know about the cause of the explosion, even
though my patients were waiting for me.
He said: ‘The power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima is far stronger than any
accumulation of chemical energy produced by the dissolution of a nitrogen
compound, such as nitro-glycerine. It was an atomic bomb, produced by atomic
fission.’
‘Good heavens! At last we have atomic fission!’ I said, though somewhat
doubtfully.
Just then the long continuous wail of a siren arose.
‘Listen.… Here comes the regular air-raid.’
‘The first warning. … The enemy are on their way.’…
About thirty minutes later the all-clear sounded. I said to myself: In Nagasaki
everything is still all right.…

I went down to the consulting room, humming cheerfully.…
I stuck the pneumo-thorax needle into the side of the chest of the patient lying on
the bed. It was just after eleven a.m.
I heard a low droning sound, like that of distant aeroplane engines.
‘What’s that?’ I said. ‘The all-clear has gone, hasn’t it?’
At the same time the sound of the plane’s engines, growing louder and louder,
seemed to swoop down over the hospital.
I shouted: ‘It’s an enemy plane! Look out—take cover!’

As I said so, I pulled the needle out of the patient and threw myself beside the
bed.
There was a blinding white flash of light, and the next moment—Bang! Crack! A
huge impact like a gigantic blow smote down upon our bodies, our heads and our
hospital. I lay flat—I didn’t know whether or not of my own volition. Then down
came piles of debris, slamming into my back.
The hospital has been hit, I thought. I grew dizzy, and my ears sang.
Some minutes or so must have passed before I staggered to my feet and looked
around. The air was heavy with yellow smoke; white flakes of powder drifted about;
it was strangely dark.
Thank God, I thought—I’m not hurt! But what about the patients?…
No one knew what had happened. A huge force had been released above our
heads. What it was, nobody knew. Had it been several tons of bombs, or the suicidal
destruction of a plane carrying a heavy bomb-load?
Dazed, I retreated into the consulting room, in which the only upright object on
the rubbish-strewn floor was my desk. I went and sat on it and looked out of the
window at the yard and the outside world. There was not a single pane of glass in
the window, not even a frame—all had been completely blown away. Out in the
yard dun-colored smoke or dust cleared little by little. I saw figures running. Then,
looking to the south-west, I was stunned. The sky was as dark as pitch, covered with
dense clouds of smoke; under that blackness, over the earth, hung a yellow-brown
fog. Gradually the veiled ground became visible, and the view beyond rooted me to
the spot with horror.
All the buildings I could see were on fire: large ones and small ones and those
with straw-thatched roofs. Further off along the valley, Urakami Church, the largest
Catholic church in the east, was ablaze. The technical school, a large two-storeyed
wooden building, was on fire, as were many houses and the distant ordnance
factory. Electricity poles were wrapped in flame like so many pieces of kindling.
Trees on the nearby hills were smoking, as were the leaves of sweet potatoes in the
fields. To say that everything burned is not enough. It seemed as if the earth itself
emitted fire and smoke, flames that writhed up and erupted from underground. The
sky was dark, the ground was scarlet, and in between hung clouds of yellowish
smoke. Three kinds of colour—black, yellow and scarlet—loomed ominously over
the people, who ran about like so many ants seeking to escape. What had happened?
Urakami Hospital had not been bombed—I understood that much. But that ocean of
fire, that sky of smoke! It seemed like the end of the world.…
About ten minutes after the explosion, a big man, half-naked, holding his head
between his hands, came into the yard towards me, making sounds that seemed to
be dragged from the pit of his stomach.
‘Got hurt, sir,’ he groaned; he shivered as if he were cold. ‘I’m hurt.’
I stared at him, at the strange-looking man. Then I saw it was Mr Zenjiro
Tsujimoto, a market-gardener and a friendly neighbour to me and the hospital. I
wondered what had happened to the robust Zenjiro.
‘What’s the matter with you, Tsujimoto?’ I asked him, holding him in my arms.
‘In the pumpkin field over there—getting pumpkins for the patients—got hurt …’
he said, speaking brokenly and breathing feebly.

It was all he could do to keep standing. Yet it didn’t occur to me that he had been
seriously injured.
‘Come along now,’ I said. ‘You are perfectly all right, I assure you. Where’s your
shirt? Lie down and rest somewhere where it’s cool. I’ll be with you in a moment.’
His head and his face were whitish; his hair was singed. It was because his
eyelashes had been scorched away that he seemed so bleary-eyed. He was half-naked
because his shirt had been burned from his back in a single flash. But I wasn’t aware
of such facts. I gazed at him as he reeled about with his head between his hands.
What a change had come over this man who was stronger than a horse, whom I had
last seen earlier that morning. It’s as if he’s been struck by lightning, I thought.
After Mr Tsujimoto came staggering up to me, another person who looked just
like him wandered into the yard. Who he was and where he had come from I had no
idea. ‘Help me,’ he said, groaning, half-naked, holding his head between his hands.
He sat down, exhausted. ‘Water… Water …’ he whispered.
‘What’s the trouble? What’s wrong with you? What’s become of your shirt?’ I
demanded.
‘Hot-hot … Water… I’m burning.’ They were the only words that were articulate.
As time passed, more and more people in a similar plight came up to the hospital
—ten minutes, twenty minutes, an hour after the explosion. All were of the same
appearance, sounded the same. ‘I’m hurt, hurt! I’m burning! Water!’ They all
moaned the same lament. I shuddered. Half-naked or stark naked, they walked with
strange, slow steps, groaning from deep inside themselves as if they had travelled
from the depths of hell. They looked whitish; their faces were like masks. I felt as if I
were dreaming, watching pallid ghosts processing slowly in one direction—as in a
dream I had once dreamt in my childhood.
These ghosts came on foot uphill towards the hospital, from the direction of the
burning city and from the more easterly ordnance factory. Worker or student, girl or
man, they all walked slowly and had the same mask-like face. Each one groaned and
cried for help. Their cries grew in strength as the people increased in number,
sounding like something from the Buddhist scriptures, re-echoing everywhere, as if
the earth itself were in pain.
One victim who managed to reach the hospital yard asked me, ‘Is this a hospital?’
before suddenly collapsing on the ground. There were those who lay stiffly where
they fell by the roadside in front of the hospital; others lay in the sweet-potato
fields. Many went down to the steep valley below the hospital where a stream ran
down between the hill of Motohara and the next hill. ‘Water, water,’ they cried. They
went instinctively down to the banks of the stream, because their bodies had been
scorched and their throats were parched and inflamed; they were thirsty. I didn’t
realize then that these were the symptoms of ‘flash-burn.’…
In the afternoon a change was noticeable in the appearance of the injured people
who came up to the hospital. The crowd of ghosts which had looked whitish in the
morning were now burned black. Their hair was burnt; their skin, which was charred
and blackened, blistered and peeled. Such were those who now came toiling up to
the hospital yard and fell there weakly.
‘Are you a doctor? Please, if you wouldn’t mind, could you examine me?’ So said
a young man.
‘Cheer up!’ I said. It was all I could say.

He died in the night. He must have been one of the many medical students who
were injured down at the medical college. His politeness and then his poor
blackened body lying dead on the concrete are things I shall never forget.
THE CONTROVERSY OVER MEMORY: JOHN DOWER
This account was written by a historian specializing in international relations and
Japan. It describes the controversy that arose over the proposed Smithsonian
commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the bomb in 1995. A host of groups,
spearheaded by several veterans’ organizations, attacked the original plans, which
had been prepared by a variety of historians and other experts. The opposition,
echoed in a Congress dominated by conservatives, prompted the museum to back
down and offer a minimal display centered around the airplane Enola Gay itself.
This decision brought another set of protests, including criticisms from Japanese
authorities who felt that the United States was adopting a double standard: real
confrontation with historical issues for others, congratulatory history for itself.

REMEMBERING THE BOMB

Fiftieth anniversaries are unlike other commemorative occasions, especially when
they are anniversaries of war. Participants in the events of a half century ago are
still alive to tell their emotional personal tales. Their oral histories confront the
skepticism and detachment of younger generations who have no memories of the
war. Historians with access to materials that were previously inaccessible (or simply
ignored) develop new perspectives on the dynamics and significance of what took
place. Politicians milk the still palpable human connection between past and present
for every possible drop of ideological elixir. History, memory, scholarship, and
politics become entangled in intricate ways.…
It is a measure of the impoverishment of our present-day political climate in the
United States that Americans have been denied a rare opportunity to use the fiftieth
anniversary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to reflect more deeply about these
developments that changed our world forever. That opportunity was lost early this
year when the Smithsonian Institution, bowing to political pressure (including
unanimous condemnation by the United States Senate), agreed to scale back
drastically a proposed major exhibition on the atomic bombs and the end of the war
against Japan in its Air and Space Museum in Washington.
The exhibition initially envisioned by the Smithsonian’s curators would have
taken viewers through a succession of rooms that introduced, in turn, the ferocity of
the last year of the war in Asia, the Manhattan Project and the unfolding imperatives
behind the United States decision to use the bombs against Japan, the training and
preparation of the Enola Gay mission that dropped the first bomb on Hiroshima
(with the fuselage of the Enola Gay as the centerpiece of the exhibition), the human
consequences of the bombs in the two target cities, and the nuclear legacy to the
postwar world. The draft script included occasional placards that concisely
summarized the “historical controversies” that have emerged in scholarship and
public discourse.
This ambitious proposal proved to be politically unacceptable. The Senate

denounced the draft script as being “revisionist and offensive to many World War II
veterans.” Critics accused curators responsible for the draft of being “politically
correct” leftists and rarely hesitated to brand as “anti-American” anyone who
questioned the use of the bombs. Confronted by such criticism, and by a
conservative Congress threatening to cut off federal funding to “liberal” projects in
general, the Smithsonian—like Japan fifty years earlier—surrendered
unconditionally. Visitors to the Air and Space Museum eventually were offered only
a minimalist exhibition featuring the refurbished fuselage of the Enola Gay and a
brief tape and text explaining that this was the plane that dropped the first atomic
bomb, following which, nine days later, Japan surrendered. The artifact, supporters
of this bare presentation declare, speaks for itself.
Artifacts do not in fact speak for themselves. Essentially the United States
government has chosen to commemorate the end of World War II in Asia by
affirming that only one orthodox view is politically permissible. This orthodoxy
amounts to a “heroic” narrative, and its contours are simple: The war in Asia was a
brutal struggle against a fanatic, expansionist foe (which is true, albeit cavalier
about European and American colonial and neocolonial control in Asia up to 1941).
That righteous war against Japanese aggression was ended by the dropping of the
atomic bombs, which saved the enormous numbers of American lives that would
have been sacrificed in invading Japan. As the Senate’s condemnation of the
Smithsonian’s plans put it, the atomic bombs brought the war to a “merciful” end.
… The triumphal American narrative offers an entirely understandable view of
World War II—emphasizing the enormity of German and Japanese behavior,
eulogizing American “valor and sacrificial service” (in the words of the Senate
resolution), and applauding the bombs for forcing Japan’s surrender and saving
American lives.
But what does this heroic narrative leave out? What are the “historical
controversies” the Smithsonian’s curators thought worth making known to the
public? What might we have learned from a truly serious commemorative
engagement with the end of the war in Asia?
There are many answers. To begin, the argument that the bombs were used simply
to end the war quickly and thereby save untold lives neglects complicating facts,
converging motives and imperatives, and possible alternative policies for ending the
war. Such considerations can do more than deepen our retrospective understanding
of the decision to use the bombs. They also can help us better appreciate the
complexities of crisis policy making in general.
If, moreover, we are willing to look beyond the usual end point in the
conventional heroic narrative—beyond (or beneath) the sparkling Enola Gay and the
almost abstract mushroom cloud—we can encounter the human face of World War
II. Humanizing the civilians killed and injured by the bombs, and, indeed,
humanizing the Japanese enemy generally, is difficult and distasteful for most
Americans. If this is done honestly in the context of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it
becomes apparent that we confront something more than the human consequences
of nuclear war. We are forced to ask painful questions about the morality of modern
war itself—specifically, the transformation of moral consciousness that, well before
the atomic bombs were dropped, had led all combatants to identify civilian men,
women, and children as a legitimate target of “total war.”
To engage the war at this level is to enter the realm of tragic, rather than
triumphal, narratives. As the Smithsonian controversy revealed, however, even after

the passage of a half century there is little tolerance of such reflection in the United
States, and now virtually none at all at the level of public institutions. We have
engaged in self-censorship and are the poorer for it.
… Critics of the Air and Space Museum’s early scripts emphasized what was
missing in them—most notably, a vivid sense of the fanaticism, ferocity, and
atrocious war conduct of the Japanese enemy. This was a fair criticism. Using the
same criteria, it also is fair to ask what the heroic American narrative of the end of
the war neglects.
At the simplest level, the popular triumphal narrative tends to neglect events and
developments that are deemed important in the scholarly literature on the bombs.
The entry of the Soviet Union into the war against Japan on August 8, two days
after the bombing of Hiroshima, for example, tends to be downplayed or entirely
ignored—and with it the fact that the American leadership had solicited the Soviet
entry from an early date, knew it was imminent, and knew the Japanese were
terrified by the prospect. Why the haste to drop the bombs before the effect of the
Soviet entry could be gauged?
The nuclear devastation of Nagasaki on August 9 is similarly marginalized in the
orthodox narrative. What are we to make of this second bomb? Why was it dropped
before Japan’s high command had a chance to assess Hiroshima and the Soviet
entry? How should we respond to the position taken by some Japanese—namely,
that the bombing of Hiroshima may have been necessary to crack the no-surrender
policy of the militarists, but the bombing of Nagasaki was plainly and simply a war
crime.…
Shortly after the end of the war, United States intelligence experts themselves
publicly concluded that Japan was already at the end of its tether when the bombs
were dropped.… [This raises] pertinent questions about the nature and shortcoming
of wartime Allied intelligence evaluations of the enemy.
It also became known after Japan’s surrender that alternatives to using the bombs
on civilian targets had been broached in American official circles. Navy planners
believed that Japan could be brought to its knees by intensified economic
strangulation (the country’s merchant marine and most of its navy had been sunk by
1945). Within the Manhattan Project, the possibility of dropping the bomb on a
noncombat “demonstration” target, with Japanese observers present, had been
broached but rejected. Conservative officials such as Acting Secretary of State
Joseph Grew, the former ambassador to Japan, argued that the Japanese could be
persuaded to surrender if the United States abandoned its policy of “unconditional
surrender” and guaranteed the future existence of the emperor system.…
These developments complicate the simple story line of the heroic narrative.
Greater complication, however, arises from the fact that declassification of the
archival record has made historians aware of how many different considerations
officials in Washington had in mind when they formulated nuclear policy in the
summer of 1945. No one denies that these policy makers desired to hasten the war’s
end and to save American lives, but no serious historian regards those as the sole
considerations driving the use of the bombs on Japanese cities.
Although the initial Anglo-American commitment to build nuclear weapons was
motivated by fear that Nazi Germany might be engaged in such a project, it is now
known that by 1943,… United States planners had identified Japan as the prime
target for such a weapon.…

Sheer visceral hatred abetted this early targeting of Japan for nuclear destruction.
Although critics of the Smithsonian’s original script took umbrage at a passing
statement that called attention to the element of vengeance in the American haste to
use the bombs, few historians (or honest participants) would discount this.
“Remember Pearl Harbor—Keep ’em Dying” was a popular military slogan from the
outset of the war, and among commentators and war correspondents at the time, it
was a commonplace that the Japanese were vastly more despised than the Germans.
As we know all too well from our vantage place fifty years later, race and ethnicity
are hardly negligible factors in the killing game.…
… In Japan, as might be expected, popular memory of the atomic bombs tends to
begin where the American narrative leaves off. In the heroic narrative, one rides
with the crew of the Enola Gay, cuts away from the scene the moment the Little Boy
bomb is released, gazes back from a great distance (over eleven miles) at a towering,
iridescent mushroom cloud. If by chance one does glance beneath the cloud, it is the
bomb’s awesome physical destructiveness that usually is emphasized. Rubble
everywhere. A silent, shattered cityscape. In this regard, the heroic narrative differs
little from a Hollywood script.
By contrast, conventional Japanese accounts begin with the solitary bomber and
its two escort planes in the azure sky above Hiroshima, with the blinding flash
(pika) and tremendous blast (don) of the nuclear explosion, with the great pillar of
smoke—and then move directly to ground zero. They dwell with excruciating detail
on the great and macabre human suffering the new weapon caused, which continues
to the present day for some survivors.
This Japanese perception of the significance of Hiroshima and Nagasaki can
become maudlin and nationalistic. The nuclear destruction of the two cities is easily
turned into a “victimization” narrative, in which the bombs fall from the heavens
without historical context—as if the war began on August 6, 1945, and innocent
Japan bore the cross of bearing witness to the horrendous birth of the nuclear age.
In this subjective narrative, the bombs become the symbolic stigmata of unique
Japanese suffering.
It is virtually a mantra in the United States media that what the Japanese really
suffer from is historical amnesia. They cannot honestly confront their World War II
past, it is said, and there are indeed numerous concrete illustrations of this beyond
fixation on the misery caused by the atomic bombs. These range from sanitized
textbooks to virtually routinized public denials of Japanese aggression and atrocity
by conservative politicians (usually associated with the Liberal Democratic party,
the United States government’s longtime protégé) to the government’s failure, until
very recently, to offer an unequivocal apology to Asian and Allied victims of
imperial Japan’s wartime conduct.
In actuality, however, popular Japanese discourse concerning both war
responsibility and the experience of the atomic bomb is more diversified than
usually is appreciated outside Japan. Since the early 1970s, when Japan belatedly
established relations with the People’s Republic of China, the Japanese media have
devoted conspicuous attention not only to exposing Japanese war crimes in Asia but
also to wrestling with the complex idea that victims (bigaisha) can simultaneously
be victimizers (kagaisha).…
Other Japanese have introduced other moral considerations in attempting to
come to grips with the meaning of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some see the bombs as
a plain atrocity—an American war crime, as it were, that cancels out, or at least

mitigates, the enormity of Japan’s own wartime transgressions. More typically,
however—and this was true even in the immediate aftermath of the bombings—antiAmerican sentiment per se is surprisingly muted. The focus instead has been on
using the bomb experience to bring an antinuclear message to the world.…
Moral reflections of this sort—by Japanese or by critics of the use of the bombs in
general—usually are given short shrift by American upholders of the heroic
narrative. In their view, war is hell, the Japanese brought the terrible denouement of
the bombs upon themselves, and the only morality worth emphasizing is the moral
superiority of the Allied cause in World War II. Indeed, one of the formulaic terms
that emerged among critics of the Air and Space Museum’s original plans (alongside
the “merciful” nature of the use of the bombs) labeled the nuclear destruction of the
two Japanese cities “morally unambiguous.”
It was not, and it may well be that the most enduring legacy of the Smithsonian
controversy will be its graphic exposure of the moral ambiguity of the use of the
bombs—and of Allied strategic bombing policy more generally. Here is where the
triumphal story line gives way to a tragic narrative. The “good war” against Axis
aggression and atrocity was brought to an end by a policy that the United States,
Great Britain, and the League of Nations all had condemned only a few years
previous, when first practiced by Japan and Germany, as “barbarous” and “in
violation of those standards of humane conduct which have been developed as an
essential part of modern civilization.” That policy was the identification of civilian
men, women, and children as legitimate targets of aerial bombardment. The United
States, President Franklin D. Roosevelt typically declared in 1940, could be proud
that it “consistently has taken the lead in urging that this inhuman practice be
prohibited.” Five years later, well before Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this inhuman
practice was standard United States operating procedure.…
Nothing brought this to life more succinctly than the juxtaposition of the Superfortress and the lunch box.
Among artifacts the Smithsonian’s curators proposed bringing to Washington
from the Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima was a seventh-grade schoolgirl’s
charred lunch box, containing carbonized rice and peas, that had been recovered
from the ashes. The girl herself had disappeared. In the Japanese milieu, this is a
typical, intensely human atomic bomb icon; and to American visitors to an
exhibition, it would be intensely human too. This pathetic artifact (and other items
like it) obsessed and alarmed critics of the proposed exhibition, and for obvious
reasons: for the little lunch box far outweighed the glistening Superfortress in the
preceding room. It would linger longer in most visitors’ memories. Inevitably, it
would force them to try imagining an incinerated child. Museum visitors who could
gaze on this plain, intimate item and still maintain that the use of the bombs was
“morally unambiguous” would be a distinct minority.
This sense of the tragedy of the war, even of the “good war” against an atrocious
Axis enemy, became lost in the polemics that engulfed the Smithsonian. Yet it is not
an original perception, certainly not new to the more civilized discourse on the
bombs that has taken place in previous years. Indeed, in oblique ways even President
Harry S Truman, a hero of the triumphal narrative, showed himself sensitive to the
tragic dimensions of his decision to use the bombs. The day after Nagasaki was
bombed, he expressed qualms about killing “all those kids.”

CHAPTER 31
THE SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY AT THE END OF THE CENTURY
China, Africa, and the Middle East
During the decades after World War II, political systems in the world seemed divided
among multiparty democracies (the West, India, Japan), Communist systems, and
authoritarian regimes (see chapter 26). Many new nations, in Africa and elsewhere,
initially tried democracy but then turned to military or one-man rule, if only
because of huge internal divisions within their countries. Democratic ideals
remained lively in areas such as Latin America and Africa, but their prospects often
seemed bleak.
Beginning in the late 1970s, democracy began to spread. Western encouragement
combined with a sense that democracy might be the best system to foster economic
growth, an alternative to heavy-handed state planning. Democratic systems gained
throughout Latin America and then in the former Communist zone of Eastern
Europe. The Soviet Union sponsored more open political activity in 1985, and the
collapse of the Soviet empire after 1989 brought democratic systems to most of the
East European states. In several non-Communist Asian states, such as South Korea
and the Philippines, authoritarian regimes were replaced by more democratic
governments. By the early 1990s democratic reforms were spreading in Africa,
though still as a minority current. The establishment of democracy in South Africa,
where the black majority had previously been excluded from voting as part of the
racist apartheid system, was a huge achievement. In 1994 Nelson Mandela became
that nation’s first democratically elected president.
The late-twentieth-century spread of democracy thus involved both situations in
which the majority of the people obtained the vote for the first time—the South
African case—and situations where free elections, with open political discussion and
choices among parties, replaced controlled voting systems—the more common exauthoritarian or ex-Communist case.
Comparing democratic movements in areas where full democracy had not
previously prevailed raises a number of analytical issues. The first involves
causation: why, in places otherwise so different, did democracy begin to provide a
more popular, acceptable political vocabulary? Do statements about democracy help
get at the general, global conditions that gave this particular political system an
edge in the final decades of the century?
Comparison also involves the usual, essential task of close analysis. Not all
democratic movements were necessarily the same. Some doubtless reflected different
contexts and traditions. Some may have been primarily for show, to win
international approval and support without real commitment.
Comparison is even more obviously essential in dealing with global exceptions to
the democratic current. Democratic sentiment increased in China during this period,
but the regime vowed to maintain a single-party, politically Communist system.
The Middle East was another region where the surge toward democracy was
halting. Israel was a well-established democracy, though with a long history of
repressing the large Palestinian (Arab) minority. Turkey and a few other Muslim
nations were democratic or made new gestures toward democracy, but in general

Islam and democracy did not readily coincide at this point. Royal, military, or oneparty rule was more common. Yet there were reasons for some new bows to
democracy in this context, given the larger global patterns. The collapse of European
Communism, and the U.S. invasion of Iraq at the end of the Cold War, made the
West a more important player in Middle Eastern affairs, a fact that could generate
more democratic influence.
The selections in this chapter come from three specific cases, all involving
advances of democratic sentiment. Two of the cases—China and the Middle East—
also involve some of the more resistant contexts. Comparison can thus highlight (1)
assessment of the democratic phenomenon in general at this time period, (2) the
search for general factors of causation, and (3) a juxtaposition of cases in which
democracy surged forward (South Africa), gained ground amid inconclusive results
(the Middle East), or had to yield to overwhelming repression even as economic
conditions and the informal political climate changed rapidly (China).
China had no deep democratic tradition. Confucianism, its dominant political
culture, was strongly hierarchical. The Chinese revolution of 1911 was led by
Western-style reformers who hoped to install a democratic system, though their own
movement, pressed by internal disarray and Japanese attack, turned increasingly
authoritarian. Chinese Communists themselves moved to reform in 1978, but mainly
in the economic sphere. A democratic surge crested in 1989, however, with a series
of demonstrations in major cities, including the capital, Beijing. The state cracked
down, dispersing the demonstrators and arresting or exiling key leaders.
The African National Congress struggled against South Africa’s rigid racial
inequality, the apartheid system. By the 1980s international opposition to the South
African regime was growing, as was internal resistance, punctuated by periodic riots
and other acts of disobedience. Government repression stiffened in the 1980s, with
many arrests, but in 1990 a new white leadership began to offer concessions. Nelson
Mandela, who headed negotiations for the black majority, had himself been a
political prisoner for many years.
Israel gained independence as a Jewish state in 1948. For decades Jewish settlers,
many of them nationalists, had been entering this historic territory, which was
dominated by Arab settlers and held as a mandate territory (essentially, a colony) by
Britain. Arab guerrilla action continued in subsequent years, amid Arabs who
remained in Israel as well as those in neighboring states. In 1964 the dissident Arabs
formed the Palestinian Liberation Organization. The PLO continually vowed to
destroy Israel and emphasized terrorist attacks. But there were other tactics as well,
and in the late 1980s efforts to appeal to world opinion helped prompt PLO leaders
to deemphasize terrorism in favor of broader political claims—including attacks on
the Israeli state as fascist. By the mid-1990s negotiations with Israel, strongly backed
by the United States and West European powers, led to some compromise.
Autonomous (but not independent) Palestinian territories were established within
Israel, and the PLO took over their government with a pledge to set up a democracy.
Questions
1. What were the main arguments of the Chinese democrats? Why did some
advocates anticipate difficulties in meshing democracy with Chinese traditions and
current conditions?
2. Why did democracy provide a useful vocabulary in attacks on South Africa’s
racist regime?

3. Do the African and Chinese statements display the same basic definition of
democracy? What factors might explain any differences?
4. Is the PLO declaration democratic? What factors might explain some PLO
hesitation about full commitment to democracy? Are actual democratic
procedures suggested?
5. What causes for increased global interest in democracy do the selections
collectively suggest?
6. What differences were there in the definition and precision of democratic
commitment among the Chinese students, Nelson Mandela, and the PLO?
7. What different world patterns favored or impeded democracy at the end of the
twentieth century?
For Further Discussion
1. What is a viable definition of democracy that fits global, and not just Western,
conditions?
2. Is democracy an easy system to establish in areas that lack explicit democratic
precedents? What kinds of conditions in the late twentieth century most favor the
installation of new democracies?
3. Why, by the late 1980s and the 1990s, was Africa more friendly to the installation
of new democracies than China or the Middle East?
4. Did Palestinian ideas about democracy reflect Muslim political traditions (see
chapter 7), or was this a more purely secular movement?
5. Do you think democracy will spread further—for example, to China?
CHINESE DEMOCRATIC DISSIDENTS: HAN MINZHU
The following passages were collected and issued by an anonymous 1989 dissident
who used the Chinese words for “Han democracy” as his pseudonym (Han being
China’s dominant ethnic group). After the government crackdown, publishing
prodemocratic materials was extremely dangerous, though there was a
postrepression flurry of such writings; some activists, including dissidents now in
exile, have continued such efforts.
•••
From a 1989 Poster at the People’s University
… The government is facing bankruptcy. It has no money for education, no money
for national defense, no money for energy, no money for transportation. It does not
even have enough money to keep the living standard of ordinary state employees up
to previous levels. Where has all the money gone? It has gone into the pockets of the
corrupt officials, into the banking accounts of those big and small leaders who enjoy
authority. The small amount of capital people have toiled to create has turned into
Mercedes Benzes and Cadillacs—cars on the streets—and into hotels and restaurants
[where these big and small leaders dine, stay, and entertain their relatives and
friends for free].…
Political corruption is the key problem [facing China]. The only weapon for
smashing dictatorship and autocracy and ending all types of corruption that plague
China is democracy. The power [presently] concentrated in individuals and a small
portion of the people must be restricted; there must be some mechanism of checks

and balances. The most basic meaning of democracy is that people themselves
administer matters. In modern countries, direct democracy is not easy to implement;
therefore, it is transformed into indirect democracy, that is, people entrust part of
their power to others, and these people so entrusted are selected by the people. Since
people are concerned that the people entrusted by them may abuse their power, they
establish several institutions that counterbalance each other, and each institution is
independently responsible to the people. This is the basic principle of democracy.

What does China have? Nothing. On hearing [calls] for democracy, the
government says that the level of the people is too low for the implementation of
democracy. But they have forgotten that when Chiang Kai-shek [the head of the
Nationalist Party] ran the country under a dictatorship, one of his rationales was
that the people were unenlightened and that they needed “instructive politics.” When
the Communist Party was fighting Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Party, the
Party was eager to demand democracy. How can it be that the Chinese people are,
after forty years of communist leadership, still in the same ignorant condition as
they were under Chiang Kai-shek’s regime? If some old people over the age of fifty
are unenlightened, this can be blamed on Chiang Kai-shek. But people under the age
of fifty were all born “under the red flag and raised under the red flag”! How can it
be that forty years of communist rule have produced a citizenship that is not even fit
for a democratic society? Is this self-contradictory? On the one hand, the party
boasts in its propaganda of forty years of achievements. On the other hand, it denies
those achievements [by denying that the people are ready for democracy]. What
kind of logic is this? There is no way out for China if we do not have democracy
now.
Of course, we do not expect to achieve a perfect and beautiful democratic society
at once; after all, the Chinese people have not had a single day of a free life. The
dictatorship of thousands of years, particularly that of the last several decades, has
made most people unable to adjust quickly to a democratic society. But this is no
excuse for not having a democracy. Certainly, at least urban citizens, intellectuals,
and Communist Party members are as ready for democracy as any of the citizens
who already live in democratic societies. Thus, we should at least implement
complete democracy within the Communist Party and within the urban areas.
Furthermore, during the process of urbanization, we should see that people in those
[rapidly developing] rural areas become acquainted with democracy.…
… Chinese intellectuals still possess aristocratic airs: even in the revolutions for
freedom and equality, they always give the impression of belonging to a class
superior to others. Everyone is born equal; this issue was resolved during the
Enlightenment. People’s level of education may be high or low, and their
contributions to society large or small, but they are all born as people and deserve
the same respect. They all have the same right to pursue a good life. Intellectuals
should not separate themselves from other classes and cannot claim special rights
and interests. Intellectuals should be the spokesmen for the entire nation and the
vanguard of social justice. The achievements of this movement that has been
initiated by intellectuals will in the end be measured by the influence it has on the
people. We should put our efforts into thinking about the future of the Chinese
people. We should only be responsible to the people. Democracy and equality are

like Siamese twins; one cannot have one without the other.
China’s future rests on the shoulders of her one billion people. Only if we
implement widespread democracy and more flexible economic policies will China
have a way out. Democracy will check the hereditary system [that breeds
corruption]; limited privatization will accelerate the development of the economy;
freedom of speech and freedom of the press will provide effective supervision over
the government; and equality will unite people into a greater force. But none of this
will come to us: we must reach out and struggle for it.
Essay on a Banner in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, 1989
… We have never cast off the specter of authoritarianism which, either in the form
of naked tyranny or in the cloak of idealism, never ceases to hover above our heads,
sucking away the vitality of our nation and leaving our creativity sucked dry. Under
the authoritarian system, the leaden weights of totalitarian politics and an unfree
economy have suppressed the talents and wisdom of this most gifted people in the
world. Mired in this stagnation, our nation becomes poorer and more backward with
each passing day. China can be saved only if our political system is fundamentally
transformed. Only democracy can save China. Our ancestors missed many
opportunities for cultural regeneration. We cannot afford to miss another such
opportunity.…
“There is never such a thing as a Savior.” Let those who think themselves
intelligent for advocating “old” authoritarianism or “new” authoritarianism [realize
the impotence of their schemes] in the face of the people’s immense power, and
crawl off to console themselves. The realization of democracy cannot be dependent
upon the benevolence of any person, as no dictator has ever shown a benevolent
heart. Receiving alms while sitting locked in a cage is not democracy. Democracy
can only be obtained by the struggle of the people themselves. It’s nonsense to say
that “the people would not know how to exercise democratic rights” or “democracy
is not suited to the national conditions.” Democracy has always been given to the
government by the people, and not the other way round.
Democracy is not a mystical concept; it is a concrete way of conducting your life.
It means that you can choose your own path in life. It means that you have the right
to improve your government, the right to express your thoughts freely, and the right
to write books and spread your beliefs. It means that every single person must abide
by the law, while at the same time each may use your intelligence to the fullest to
have a [bad] law rescinded. Under democracy, you can be free from the terror of a
government which acts without the least regard for human life. In other words, if
democracy is trampled upon, then the dark shadows of authoritarianism will be cast
into the life of every individual. In China, it has always been the case that the
officials are allowed to get away with arson while the people may not even light
their lamps. In China, no one has ever valued the individual—“a human life isn’t
worth a cent.” In China, no one has ever heeded the groans of the common people.
It’s about time, my fellow Chinese! We do not want to live our lives in this manner
any more!…
It’s about time, my fellow Chinese. Let us break our chains and become free
human beings. Let us rise and free our country from the vicious cycle of its history.
With the blood of our devotion let us light the torch of truth, and let it illuminate
this dark wilderness at this last moment before daybreak. The power of democracy is
like a spring tide bursting through a tiny opening—once it starts coming there is no

way to counter its force. This is where the hearts of the people lie. This is the march
of history. How then can we let this hope be stifled?
SOUTH AFRICA: NELSON MANDELA’S ADDRESS
This speech occurred on Nelson Mandela’s release from prison, February 11, 1990.
•••
Friends, comrades and fellow South Africans.
I greet you all in the name of peace, democracy and freedom for all.
I stand here before you not as a prophet but as a humble servant of you, the
people. Your tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be here
today. I therefore place the remaining years of my life in your hands.
On this day of my release, I extend my sincere and warmest gratitude to the
millions of my compatriots and those in every corner of the globe who have
campaigned tirelessly for my release.…
I salute the African National Congress. It has fulfilled our every expectation in its
role as leader of the great march to freedom.…
I greet the traditional leaders of our country—many of you continue to walk in
the footsteaps of great heroes like Hintsa and Sekhukune.
I pay tribute to the endless heroism of youth, you, the young lions. You, the young
lions, have energized our entire struggle.
I pay tribute ot he mothers and wives and sisters of our nation. You are the rockhard foundation of our struggle. Apartheid has inflicted more pain on you than on
anyone else.
On this occasion, we thank the world community for their great contribution to
the anti-apartheid struggle. Without your support our struggle would not have
reached this advanced stage. The sacrifice of the frontline states will be remembered
by South Africans forever.…

Today the majority of South Africans, black and white, recognize that apartheid
has no future. It has to be ended by our own decisive mass action in order to build
peace and security. The mass campaign of defiance and other actions of our
organization and people can only culminate in the establishment of democracy. The
destruction caused by apartheid on our subcontinent is incalculable. The fabric of
family life of millions of my people has been shattered. Millions are homeless and
unemployed. Our economy lies in ruins and our people are embroiled in political
strife. Our resort to the armed struggle in 1960 with the formation of the military
wing of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe, was a purely defensive action against the
violence of apartheid. The factors which necessitated the armed struggle still exist
today. We have no option but to continue. We express the hope that a climate
conducive to a negotiated settlement will be created soon so that there may no
longer be the need for the armed struggle.…
There are further steps that have to be met before negotiations on the basic
demands of our people can begin. I reiterate our call for, inter alia, the immediate
ending of the State of Emergency and the freeing of all, and not only some, political
prisoners. Only such a normalized situation, which allows for free political activity,

can allow us to consult our people in order to obtain a mandate.
The people need to be consulted on who will negotiate and on the content of such
negotiations. Negotiations cannot take place above the heads or behind the backs of
our people. It is our belief that the future of our country can only be determined by
a body which is democratically elected on a non-racial basis. Negotiations on the
dismantling of apartheid will have to address the overwhelming demand of our
people for a democratic, non-racial and unitary South Africa. These also must be
political and economic systems to ensure that the inequalities of apartheid are
addressed and our society thoroughly democratized.…
Our struggle has reached a decisive moment. We call on our people to seize this
moment so that the process towards democracy is rapid and uninterrupted. We have
waited too long for our freedom. We can no longer wait. Now is the time to
intensify the struggle on all fronts. To relax our efforts now would be a mistake
which generations to come will not be able to forgive. The sight of freedom looming
on the horizon should encourage us to redouble our efforts.
It is only through disciplined mass action that our victory can be assured. We call
on our white compatriots to join us in the shaping of a new South Africa. The
freedom movement is a political home for you too. We call on the international
community to continue the campaign to isolate the apartheid regime. To lift
sanctions now would be to run the risk of aborting the process towards the complete
eradication of apartheid.
Our march to freedom is irreversible. We must not allow fear to stand in our way.
Universal suffrage on a common voters’ role in a united democratic and non-racial
South Africa is the only way to peace and racial harmony.
THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION: PROCLAMATION, 1988
The 1988 declaration was part of an internal reshuffling within this organization,
operating from headquarters in exile and vigorously opposing Israeli policy. Using
democratic language, PLO leaders hailed negotiations with leading (authoritarian)
Arab states like Syria and also insisted on purging certain leaders assigned to
regional responsibilities in the Gaza area (one of the areas heavily populated by
Palestinians that is now part of the Palestinian autonomy territory). The PLO also
refers to renewed agitation against Israel in its United National Command and seeks
to raise support among ordinary Palestinians.

O masses of our people
Forty years have passed since the expulsion of our people from its homeland and the
attempt to liquidate its existence and its national existence, but our valiant people is
stronger than the expulsion and the efforts to suppress its identity. Its national
revolution has succeeded, through the continuous processions of martyrs and
victims, in thwarting those attempts and in gaining international recognition for its
legitimate national rights [and] for its exclusive representation by the PLO. In the
forefront of these rights is the right of return, self-determination, and the
establishment of an independent national state under the leadership of the PLO.
The achievements of the Palestinian revolution, the glory of the magnificent
uprising which is entering its sixth month, are continuing tirelessly and relentlessly.
When our people declared the uprising, it understood the scale of the sacrifices that
would be required for liberation and independence.

Our people, who declared the uprising, is aware of the dimensions of the sacrifice
that will be demanded of it on the road to national liberation. The people
consciously pay the price for its aspirations in the form of victims, wounded,
detainees, and deportees. [It] grasps the nature of the enemy with whom it is locked
in struggle, his barbarism and the actions of his fascist forces, such as the use of
poison gas, bullets, house demolitions, and a criminal war of starvation. Despite this,
our people has chosen the road of struggle and sacrifice as the only road through
which to achieve its national rights.
Just as our people grasps the essence of the enemy, so it is also aware of the
character of the war it is waging. Our war is a lengthy one. It is a war of attrition in
which each passing day raises the economic and political price paid by the occupier
[Israel], intensifies his international isolation, exposes the ugly truth about the
occupation, and shatters the illusion of coexistence that the enemy has tried to
foster. Moreover, it reinforces our legitimate national rights.

The glorious December uprising was launched to demonstrate the solid strength of
the fighting army and to raise the [people’s] struggle and its national cause to a new
level of which the axis is the continuation of the struggle and the resistance and
escalation of the confrontation toward civil disobedience.
The United National Command of the Uprising, as it pursues the struggle with you
and through you, under the banners of our sole legitimate representative, the PLO,
reaffirms our people’s readiness for great sacrifices and devotion, to move toward
civil disobedience, meaning primarily the liberation of our masses from the
occupation and all that this entails: sacrifices and belt-tightening, storing basic
foodstuffs, storing medicines, suffering for the sake of the homeland, and relentless
and tireless forbearance and determination. The United Command stresses the
determination of the uprising masses to remove all the obstacles on the road to civil
disobedience, involving especially the resignation of all [the personnel in] the
mechanisms of the occupation such as the tax apparatus, the police, and the
appointed municipalities.
O our glorious masses,
1. The United National Command welcomes the removal of the obstacles on the
road to normalization of Palestinian-Syrian relations and on the road to perfection
of Palestinian national unity through a constructive democratic dialogue. Marginal
disputes must not be encouraged. We must turn to democratic dialogue as the only
means for settling internal disputes. [The United Command] condemns those who
deviate from the unity of our people and are splitting its ranks.…
2. The immediate resignation must be effected of department directors in the Civil
Administration in Gaza.… Let there be no mistake: the masses of the uprising and
the shock squads will punish those who deviate from the will of the people and the
decisions of its Command when they see fit.
3. Establishment of the popular committees and their dispersal in all areas must
be completed. There must be no delay in executing this struggle mission. The other
functional popular committees have the task of organizing the inhabitants’ lives and
ensuring proper services—food supplies, medicine, education, and security. For the
popular committees are the government of the people and the uprising, a substitute

for the collapsing occupation mechanisms, and a political tool for introducing civil
disobedience and making it succeed.
4. Beat vigorously policemen, collaborators, and members of appointed municipal
councils who, by not resigning from the service of the enemy, deviate from the
national consensus.

CHAPTER 32
ISSUES OF CULTURAL IDENTITY
Africa and Latin America
This chapter focuses on efforts by intellectuals to define the position of their cultures
—one Nigerian, one Mexican—in a period of rapid cultural change. Both areas had
witnessed important cultural impositions by other societies, including Western
Europe and the United States. Both, however, retained prior cultural traditions and
an active desire to assert a distinctive identity. Identity issues ride high on the
contemporary global agenda. How can societies handle new cultural forms, often
brought through outside influences, and still retain a link to their cultural roots?
The past hundred years have been a period of major cultural change, almost
literally worldwide. No culture retained all of the key assumptions and values that
had predominated in 1900. Yet the patterns of change were complex. In a number of
societies, the strength of traditional religion weakened as it faced competition from
new beliefs such as nationalism, consumer materialism, or Marxism. But in certain
cases new religious enthusiasms spread. Thus, in sub-Saharan Africa there were
many conversions to Islam and Christianity: where 80 percent of the population was
committed to some form of polytheism in 1900, only 20 percent retained primary
commitment to polytheistic beliefs by the 1990s. Latin America, converted earlier to
Catholicism (though often in combination with older American Indian or African
beliefs), saw a wave of enthusiasm for fundamentalist Protestantism toward the end
of the twentieth century. Several societies, finally, including Hindu-dominated India
and the Islamic Middle East, experienced a surge of religious revival from the 1970s
onward. Cultural change was the order of the day, but the overall directions were far
from clear.
One issue loomed large, though it was handled differently depending on current
beliefs and past traditions: the influence of Western culture was a formidable force
for change. From the West many societies incorporated new political beliefs,
including aspects of representative democracy and, of course, nationalism. But the
most important pressures from the West involved the power of modern science and
the seductions of material acquisition (consumerism) and individual advancement.
Latin America and Africa faced particular pressures from outside cultural forces.
Many Latin Americans had long looked to Western Europe for cultural models,
beginning with Catholicism. Africa had more recently undergone Western
imperialism, leading to new systems of education, missionary activity, and the
general force of consumerism. Neither society was culturally fully Western, because
of the diverse cultural groups that remained active and because of powerful prior
traditions; yet neither could easily rely on traditional values to define personal
beliefs or larger identities.
Not surprisingly, intellectuals in twentieth-century Africa and Latin America
worried extensively about identity, particularly in relationship to Europe and the
United States. African writers, usually educated in Western schools and writing in
English or French, tried to deal with the need for a definable culture that would be
something more than derivative. Latin American thinkers, with a longer tradition of
encountering Western influence but equally preoccupied with defining values that
were both distinctive and appropriate to the modern world, used history and

comparison to try to define the flavor of their cultures.
This chapter features selections from two novels by the leading Nigerian novelist,
Chinua Achebe, where he discusses successive phases of Western influence on Africa,
first Christian, then urban-consumer. Writing from the 1950s onward, Achebe was
fascinated by the process of change, which he felt undermined a coherent traditional
culture but brought some undeniable benefits. The titles of his novels, Things Fall
Apart and No Longer at Ease, suggest the confusions he believed change had created,
as Africans renounced older belief patterns without fully clear or valid substitutes.
Achebe’s characterizations should be considered along with African nationalist
views (chapter 25) and the views of African women (chapter 29), to widen the
picture of African culture in a century of varied change.
A second set of selections comes from an essay collection by the prizewinning
Mexican novelist and essayist, Octavio Paz, written initially in the 1950s and
supplemented in a 1970s edition. Paz attempts to define essential features of
Mexican culture, while comparing it with what he sees as the culture of the United
States, Mexico’s powerful neighbor, and the more general forces of modern
economic life. His impressions of cultural change differ from those of Achebe, but he
grapples with some of the same issues of distinctive identity.
The passages below flow from the pens of intellectuals. They do not necessarily
represent popular cultural beliefs, though they try to fathom popular values.
Interpreting the significance of the passages has to involve some thinking about the
role of intellectuals in modern life, in civilizations generally, and in Africa and Latin
America in particular. Are the concerns of intellectuals particularly significant or
revealing? Comparisons remain important as well. Africa and Latin America faced
the same cultural and identity issues. What are the most important differences?
Questions
1. What forces of change does Achebe deal with in his successive novelistic
treatments of Nigeria? How do the shifts under Christian missionary influence,
around 1900, compare with those of urban Nigeria in the 1920s, still under British
rule?
2. What kinds of people were most open to Western-inspired cultures? What kinds
resisted most firmly? Does Achebe believe that a coherent new culture emerged?
3. Does Achebe believe that it would be better for Africa if traditional values could
be restored?
4. Why does Paz argue that Mexicans seek a certain kind of solitude? How does he
define the major strengths of Mexican culture?
5. Does Paz believe that Mexican culture can accommodate to modern economic
and political life? On what basis does he criticize Western values?
6. Do Paz and Achebe define Western values in similar ways?
7. What kinds of history have shaped Mexico, according to Paz? Does he have the
same view of historical disruptions that Achebe highlights? Is his sense of the
problem of modern identity the same?
8. Which author, Paz or Achebe, is more hostile to Western values? Which believes
that Western values are more threatening to established cultural traditions?
9. How does Paz’s characterization of modern worker culture, in its relationship to
prior Mexican values, compare with Achebe’s description of urban standards in

relation to earlier village beliefs?
For Further Discussion
1. Is Achebe an African nationalist? How might Mexican nationalists disagree with
Paz?
2. Did intellectuals such as Achebe and Paz represent widespread popular concerns
in their respective societies? Did their views relate at all to the concerns expressed
by African and Mexican women (see chapter 29)?
3. Why were many twentieth-century African and Latin American intellectuals
particularly preoccupied with issues of cultural identity?
4. Will Latin American and African cultures become increasingly westernized in the
next few decades (and how do you define cultural westernization)?
NIGERIA: CHINUA ACHEBE
Chinua Achebe, born in 1930, wrote a series of novels on the impact of the West on
his native Nigeria, titling the first one Things Fall Apart (1958). This novel was set
in the Ibo section of Nigeria around 1900, when Western missionary activity was
increasing under the protection of British colonial rule. The passage describes the
various reasons different Africans were drawn to Christianity or resisted it. Achebe is
fascinated by the divisions among Africans in response to Western values and
colonial controls.
The second selection comes from Achebe’s novel No Longer at Ease; one of the
characters is a descendant of the same Okonkwo family, from the same village, who
had moved to Lagos (Nigeria’s capital) in the 1920s. Here the impact of Westernstyle urban culture is explored, as it further jeopardized traditional values and
behaviors. Obi Okonkwo was the first village member to have received higher
education in British-run schools, and he later obtained a civil-service job.
•••
THINGS FALL APART

The missionaries spent their first four or five nights in the marketplace, and went
into the village in the morning to preach the gospel. They asked who the king of the
village was, but the villagers told them that there was no king. “We have men of
high title and the chief priests and the elders,” they said.
It was not very easy getting the men of high title and the elders together after the
excitement of the first day. But the missionaries persevered, and in the end they were
received by the rulers of Mbanta. They asked for a plot of land to build their church.
Every clan and village had its “evil forest.” In it were buried all those who died of
the really evil diseases, like leprosy and smallpox. It was also the dumping ground
for the potent fetishes of great medicine men when they died. An “evil forest” was,
therefore, alive with sinister forces and powers of darkness. It was such a forest that
the rulers of Mbanta gave to the missionaries. They did not really want them in their
clan, and so they made them that offer which nobody in his right sense would
accept.
“They want a piece of land to build their shrine,” said Uchendu to his peers when
they consulted among themselves. “We shall give them a piece of land.” He paused,
and there was a murmur of surprise and disagreement. “Let us give them a portion
of the Evil Forest. They boast about victory over death. Let us give them a real

battlefield in which to show their victory.” They laughed and agreed, and sent for
the missionaries, whom they had asked to leave them for a while so that they might
“whisper together.” They offered them as much as the Evil Forest as they cared to
take. And to their greatest amazement the missionaries thanked them and burst into
song.

41, 162, 163, 166–67, 186–88. Copyright © 1959 by Chinua Achebe. Reprinted by

“They do not understand,” said some of the elders. “But they will understand
when they go to their plot of land tomorrow morning.” And they dispersed.
The next morning the crazy men actually began to clear a part of the forest and
to build their house. The inhabitants of Mbanta expected them all to be dead within
four days. The first day passed and the second and third and fourth, and none of
them died. Everyone was puzzled. And then it became known that the white man’s
fetish had unbelievable power. It was said that he wore glasses on his eyes so that he
could see and talk to evil spirits. Not long after, he won his first three converts.
Although Nwoye had been attracted to the new faith from the very first day, he
kept it secret. He dared not go too near the missionaries for fear of his father. But
whenever they came to preach in the open marketplace or the village playground,
Nwoye was there. And he was already beginning to know some of the simple stories
they told.
“We have now built a church,” said Mr. Kiaga, the interpreter, who was now in
charge of the infant congregation. The white man had gone back to Umuofia, where
he built his headquarters and from where he paid regular visits to Mr. Kiaga’s
congregation at Mbanta.
“We have now built a church,” said Mr. Kiaga, “and we want you all to come in
every seventh day to worship the true God.”
On the following Sunday, Nwoye passed and repassed the little red-earth and
thatch building without summoning enough courage to enter. He heard the voice of
singing and although it came from a handful of men it was loud and confident.
Their church stood on a circular clearing that looked like the open mouth of the Evil
Forest. Was it waiting to snap its teeth together? After passing and re-passing by the
church, Nwoye returned home.
It was well known among the people of Mbanta that their gods and ancestors
were sometimes long-suffering and would deliberately allow a man to go on defying
them. But even in such cases they set their limit at seven market weeks or twentyeight days. Beyond that limit no man was suffered to go. And so excitement
mounted in the village as the seventh week approached since the impudent
missionaries built their church in the Evil Forest. The villagers were so certain about
the doom that awaited these men that one or two converts thought it wise to
suspend their allegiance to the new faith.
At last the day came by which all the missionaries should have died. But they
were still alive, building a new red-earth and thatch house for their teacher, Mr.
Kiaga. That week they won a handful more converts. And for the first time they had
a woman. Her name was Nneka, the wife of Amadi, who was a prosperous farmer.
She was very heavy with child.
Nneka had had four previous pregnancies and childbirths. But each time she had

borne twins, and they had been immediately thrown away. Her husband and his
family were already becoming highly critical of such a woman and were not unduly
perturbed when they found she had fled to join the Christians. It was a good
riddance.…
“Does the white man understand our custom about land?”
“How can he when he does not even speak our tongue? But he says that our
customs are bad; and our own brothers who have taken up his religion also say that
our customs are bad. How do you think we can fight when our own brothers have
turned against us? The white man is very clever. He came quietly and peaceably
with his religion. We were amused at his foolishness and allowed him to stay. Now
he has won our brothers, and our clan can no longer act like one. He has put a knife
on the things that held us together and we have fallen apart.”…
There were many men and women in Umuofia who did not feel as strongly as
Okonkwo a traditionalist leader about the new dispensation. The white man had
indeed brought a lunatic religion, but he had also built a trading store and for the
first time palm-oil and kernel became things of great price, and much money flowed
into Umuofia.…
Mr. Brown [the missionary to the Ibo village] learned a good deal about the
religion of the clan and he came to the conclusion that a frontal attack on it would
not succeed. And so he built a school and a little hospital in Umuofia. He went from
family to family begging people to send their children to his school. But at first they
only sent their slaves or sometimes their lazy children. Mr. Brown begged and
argued and prophesied. He said that the leaders of the land in the future would be
men and women who had learned to read and write. If Umuofia failed to send her
children to the school, strangers would come from other places to rule them. They
could already see that happening in the Native Court, where the D.C. was
surrounded by strangers who spoke his tongue. Most of these strangers came from
the distant town of Umuru on the bank of the Great River where the white man first
went.
In the end Mr. Brown’s arguments began to have an effect. More people came to
learn in his school, and he encouraged them with gifts of singlets and towels. They
were not all young, these people who came to learn. Some of them were thirty years
old or more. They worked on their farms in the morning and went to school in the
afternoon. And it was not long before the people began to say that the white man’s
medicine was quick in working. Mr. Brown’s school produced quick results. A few
months in it were enough to make one a court messenger or even a court clerk.
Those who stayed longer became teachers; and from Umuofia laborers went forth
into the Lord’s vineyard. New churches were established in the surrounding villages
and a few schools with them. From the very beginning religion and education went
hand in hand.…
“You all know why we are here, when we ought to be building our barns or
mending our huts, when we should be putting our compounds in order. My father
used to say to me: ‘Whenever you see a toad jumping in broad daylight, then know
that something is after its life.’ When I saw you all pouring into this meeting from
all the quarters of our clan so early in the morning, I knew that something was after
our life.” He paused for a brief moment and then began again:
“All our gods are weeping. Idemili is weeping, Ogwugwu is weeping, Agbala is
weeping, and all the others. Our dead fathers are weeping because of the shameful
sacrilege they are suffering and the abomination we have all seen with our eyes.” He

stopped again to steady his trembling voice.
“This is a great gathering. No clan can boast of greater numbers or greater valor.
But are we all here? I ask you: Are all the sons of Umuofia with us here?” A deep
murmur swept through the crowd.
“They are not,” he said. “They have broken the clan and gone their several ways.
We who are here this morning have remained true to our fathers, but our brothers
have deserted us and joined a stranger to soil their fatherland. If we fight the
stranger we shall hit our brothers and perhaps shed the blood of a clansman. But we
must do it. Our fathers never dreamed of such a thing, they never killed their
brothers. But a white man never came to them. So we must do what our fathers
would never have done. Eneke the bird was asked why he was always on the wing
and he replied: ‘Men have learned to shoot without missing their mark and I have
learned to fly without perching on a twig.’ We must root out this evil. And if our
brothers take the side of evil we must root them out too. And we must do it now.
We must bale this water now that it is only ankle-deep.…”
At this point there was a sudden stir in the crowd and every eye was turned in one
direction. There was a sharp bend in the road that led from the marketplace to the
white man’s court, and to the stream beyond it. And so no one had seen the
approach of the five court messengers sent by English colonial leaders until they had
come round the bend, a few paces from the edge of the crowd. Okonkwo was sitting
at the edge.…
“What do you want here?”
“The white man whose power you know too well has ordered this meeting to
stop.”
In a flash Okonkwo drew his machete. The messenger crouched to avoid the blow.
It was useless. Okonkwo’s machete descended twice and the man’s head lay beside
his uniformed body.
The waiting backcloth jumped into tumultuous life and the meeting was stopped.
Okonkwo stood looking at the dead man. He knew that Umuofia would not go to
war. He knew because they had let the other messengers escape. They had broken
into tumult instead of action. He discerned fright in that tumult. He heard voices
asking: “Why did he do it?”
He wiped his machete on the sand and went away.
NO LONGER AT EASE

As a boy in the village of Umuofia he had heard his first stories about Lagos from a
soldier home on leave from the war. Those soldiers were heroes who had seen the
great world. They spoke of Abyssinia, Egypt, Palestine, Burma and so on. Some of
them had been village ne’er-do-wells, but now they were heroes. They had bags and
bags of money, and the villagers sat at their feet to listen to their stories. One of
them went regularly to a market in the neighboring village and helped himself to
whatever he liked. He went in full uniform, breaking the earth with his boots, and
no one dared touch him. It was said that if you touched a soldier, Government
would deal with you. Besides, soldiers were as strong as lions because of the
injections they were given in the army. It was from one of these soldiers that Obi
had his first picture of Lagos.
“There is no darkness there,” he told his admiring listeners, “because at night the
electric shines like the sun, and people are always walking about, that is, those who

want to walk. If you don’t want to walk you only have to wave your hand and a
pleasure car stops for you.” His audience made sounds of wonderment. Then by way
of digression he said: “If you see a white man, take off your hat for him. The only
thing he cannot do is mold a human being.”
For many years afterwards, Lagos was always associated with electric lights and
motorcars in Obi’s mind. Even after he had at last visited the city and spent a few
days there before flying to the United Kingdom his views did not change very much.
Of course, he did not really see much of Lagos then. His mind was, as it were, on
higher things. He spent the few days with his “countryman,” Joseph Okeke, a clerk in
the Survey Department. Obi and Joseph had been classmates at the Umuofia C.M.S.
Central School. But Joseph had not gone on to a secondary school because he was
too old and his parents were poor. He had joined the Education Corps of the 82nd
Division and, when the war ended, the clerical service of the Nigerian Government.
Joseph was at Lagos Motor Park to meet his lucky friend who was passing
through Lagos to the United Kingdom. He took him to his lodgings in Obalende. It
was only one room. A curtain of light-blue cloth ran the full breadth of the room
separating the Holy of Holies (as he called his double spring bed) from the sitting
area. His cooking utensils, boxes, and other personal effects were hidden away under
the Holy of Holies. The sitting area was taken up with two armchairs, a settee
(otherwise called “me and my girl”), and a round table on which he displayed his
photo album. At night, his houseboy moved away the round table and spread his
mat on the floor.
Joseph had so much to tell Obi on his first night in Lagos that it was past three
when they slept. He told him about the cinema and the dance halls and about
political meetings.

“Dancing is very important nowadays. No girl will look at you if you can’t dance.
I first met Joy at the dancing school.” “Who is Joy?” asked Obi, who was fascinated
by what he was learning of this strange and sinful new world. “She was my girl
friend for—let’s see …”—he counted off his fingers—“… March, April, May, June,
July—for five months. She made these pillowcases for me.”
Obi raised himself instinctively to look at the pillow he was lying on. He had
taken particular notice of it earlier in the day. It had the strange word osculate sewn
on it, each letter in a different color.
“She was a nice girl but sometimes very foolish. Sometimes, though, I wish we
hadn’t broken up. She was simply mad about me; and she was a virgin when I met
her, which is very rare here.”
Joseph talked and talked and finally became less and less coherent. Then without
any pause at all his talk was transformed into a deep snore, which continued until
the morning.
The very next day Obi found himself taking a compulsory walk down Lewis
Street. Joseph had brought a woman home and it was quite clear that Obi’s presence
in the room was not desirable; so he went out to have a look round. The girl was
one of Joseph’s new finds, as he told him later. She was dark and tall with an
enormous pneumatic bosom under a tight-fitting red and yellow dress. Her lips and
long fingernails were a brilliant red, and her eyebrows were fine black lines. She

looked not unlike those wooden masks made in Ikot Ekpene. Altogether she left a
nasty taste in Obi’s mouth, like the multicolored word osculate on the pillowcase.…
On top of it all came his mother’s death. He sent all he could find for her funeral,
but it was already being said to his eternal shame that a woman who had borne so
many children, one of whom was in a European post, deserved a better funeral than
she got. One Umuofia man who had been on leave at home when she died brought
the news to Lagos to the meeting of the Umuofia Progressive Union.
“It was a thing of shame,” he said. Someone else wanted to know, by the way,
why that beast (meaning Obi) had not obtained permission to go home. “That is
what Lagos can do to a young man. He runs after sweet things, dances breast to
breast with women and forgets his home and his people. Do you know what
medicine that osu woman may have put into his soup to turn his eyes and ears away
from his people?”…
“Everything you have said is true. But there is one thing I want you to learn.
Whatever happens in this world has a meaning. As our people say: ‘Wherever
something stands, another thing stands beside it.’ You see this thing called blood.
There is nothing like it. That is why when you plant a yam it produces another yam,
and if you plant an orange it bears oranges. I have seen many things in my life, but I
have never yet seen a banana tree yield a coco yam. Why do I say this? You young
men here, I want you to listen because it is from listening to old men that you learn
wisdom. I know that when I return to Umuofia I cannot claim to be an old man. But
here in this Lagos I am an old man to the rest of you.” He paused for effect. “This
boy that we are all talking about, what has he done? He was told that his mother
died and he did not care. It is a strange and surprising thing.”
MEXICO: OCTAVIO PAZ
Octavio Paz was born in 1914 in Mexico City. He enjoyed an outstanding career in
poetry and criticism, founding a number of literary reviews. He served in the
Mexican diplomatic corps, though he often protested government repression of
political dissent. Paz frequently taught in the United States and wrote in English as
well as Spanish; he also developed extensive contacts with intellectual circles in
Europe. Labyrinth of Solitude, his most famous single work (published in 1962), is
an exploration of Mexican character as it was shaped historically and as it compares
to the characteristics of other nations in Latin America and the West. Paz won the
Nobel Prize in literature in 1990. He died in 1998.
•••
THE LABYRINTH OF SOLITUDE
Our [Mexican] sense of inferiority—real or imagined—might be explained at least
partly by the reserve with which the Mexican faces other people and the
unpredictable violence with which his repressed emotions break through his mask of
impassivity. But his solitude is vaster and profounder than his sense of inferiority. It
is impossible to equate these two attitudes: when you sense that you are alone, it
does not mean that you feel inferior, but rather that you feel you are different. Also,
a sense of inferiority may sometimes be an illusion, but solitude is a hard fact. We
are truly different. And we are truly alone.…
Man is alone everywhere. But the solitude of the Mexican, under the great stone
night of the high plateau that is still inhabited by insatiable gods, is very different

from that of the North American, who wanders in an abstract world of machines,
fellow citizens and moral precepts. In the Valley of Mexico man feels himself
suspended between heaven and earth, and he oscillates between contrary powers and
forces, and petrified eyes, and devouring mouths. Reality—that is, the world that
surrounds us—exists by itself here, has a life of its own, and was not invented by
man as it was in the United States. The Mexican feels himself to have been torn from
the womb of this reality, which is both creative and destructive, both Mother and
Tomb.
From Octavio Paz, The Labyrinth of Solitude, and Other Essays, trans. Lysander
Kemp, Yara Milos, and R. P. Belash (New York: Grove Press, 1985), 19, 20, 29–30,
37, 66–67, 362, 372–73, 374. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.
He has forgotten the word that ties him to all those forces through which life
manifests itself. Therefore he shouts or keeps silent, stabs or prays, or falls asleep for
a hundred years.
The history of Mexico is the history of a man seeking his parentage, his origins.
He has been influenced at one time or another by France, Spain, the United States
and the militant indigenists of his own country, and he crosses history like a jade
comet, now and then giving off flashes of lightning. What is he pursuing in his
eccentric course? He wants to go back beyond the catastrophe he suffered: he wants
to be a sun again, to return to the center of that life from which he was separated
one day. (Was that day the Conquest? Independence?) Our solitude has the same
roots as religious feelings. It is a form of orphanhood, an obscure awareness that we
have been torn from the All, and an ardent search: a flight and a return, an effort to
re-establish the bonds that unite us with the universe.…
… The Mexican is always remote, from the world and from other people. And
also from himself.
The speech of our people reflects the extent to which we protect ourselves from
the outside world: the ideal of manliness is never to “crack,” never to back down.
Those who “open themselves up” are cowards. Unlike other people, we believe that
opening oneself up is a weakness or a betrayal. The Mexican can bend, can bow
humbly, can even stoop, but he cannot back down, that is, he cannot allow the
outside world to penetrate his privacy. The man who backs down is not to be
trusted, is a traitor or a person of doubtful loyalty; he babbles secrets and is
incapable of confronting a dangerous situation. Women are inferior beings because,
in submitting, they open themselves up. Their inferiority is constitutional and resides
in their sex, their submissiveness, which is a wound that never heals.
Hermeticism is one of the several recourses of our suspicion and distrust. It shows
that we instinctively regard the world around us to be dangerous. This reaction is
justifiable if one considers what our history has been and the kind of society we
have created. The harshness and hostility of our environment and the hidden,
indefinable threat that is always afloat in the air, oblige us to close ourselves in, like
those plants that survive by storing up liquid within their spiny exteriors.…
… The Mexican, heir to the great pre-Columbian religions based on nature, is a
good deal more pagan than the Spaniard, and does not condemn the natural world.
Sexual love is not tinged with grief and horror in Mexico as it is in Spain. Instincts
themselves are not dangerous; the danger lies in any personal, individual expression
of them. … It is noteworthy that our images of the working class are not colored
with similar feelings, even though the worker also lives apart from the center of
society, physically as well as otherwise, in districts and special communities. When a

contemporary novelist introduces a character who symbolizes health or destruction,
fertility or death, he rarely chooses a worker, despite the fact that the worker
represents the death of an old society and the birth of a new.…
The modern worker lacks individuality. The class is stronger than the individual
and his personality dissolves in the generic. That is the first and gravest mutilation a
man suffers when he transforms himself into an industrial wage earner. Capitalism
deprives him of his human nature (this does not happen to the servant) by reducing
him to an element in the work process, i.e., to an object. And like any object in the
business world, he can be bought and sold. Because of his social condition he
quickly loses any concrete and human relationship to the world. The machines he
operates are not his and neither are the things he produces. Actually he is not a
worker at all, because he does not create individual works or is so occupied with one
aspect of production that he is not conscious of those he does create. He is a laborer,
which is an abstract noun designating a mere function rather than a specific job.…
… Not only the popular religion of Mexico but the Mexicans’ entire life is steeped
in Indian culture—the family, love, friendship, attitudes toward one’s father and
mother, popular legends, the forms of civility and life in common, the image of
authority and political power, the vision of death and sex, work and festivity.
Mexico is the most Spanish country in Latin America; at the same time it is the most
Indian. Mesoamerican civilization died a violent death, but Mexico is Mexico thanks
to the Indian presence. Though the language and religion, the political institutions
and the culture of the country are Western, there is one aspect of Mexico that faces
in another direction—the Indian direction. Mexico is a nation between two
civilizations and two pasts.
Above and beyond success and failure, Mexico is still asking itself the question
that has occurred to most clear-thinking Mexicans since the end of the eighteenth
century: the question about modernization. In the nineteenth century, it was
believed that to adopt the new democratic and liberal principles was enough. Today,
after almost two centuries of setbacks, we have realized that countries change very
slowly, and that if such changes are to be fruitful they must be in harmony with the
past and the traditions of each nation. And so Mexico has to find its own road to
modernity. Our past must not be an obstacle but a starting point. This is extremely
difficult, given the nature of our traditions—difficult but not impossible. To avoid
new disasters, we Mexicans must reconcile ourselves with our past: only in this way
shall we succeed in finding a route to modernity. The search for our own model of
modernization is a theme directly linked with another: today we know that
modernity, both the capitalist and the pseudo-socialist versions of the totalitarian
bureaucracies, is mortally wounded in its very core—the idea of continuous,
unlimited progress. The nations that inspired our nineteenth-century liberals—
England, France, and especially the United States—are doubting, vacillating, and
cannot find their way. They have ceased to be universal examples. The Mexicans of
the nineteenth century turned their eyes toward the great Western democracies; we
have nowhere to turn ours.… The sickness of the West is moral rather than social
and economic.… But the real, most profound discord lies in the soul. The future has
become the realm of horror, and the present has turned into a desert. The liberal
societies spin tirelessly, not forward but round and round. If they change, they are
not transfigured. The hedonism of the West is the other face of desperation; its
skepticism is not wisdom but renunciation.…

CHAPTER 33
WOMEN AND GLOBAL CHANGE
Women in virtually every part of the world encountered great changes during the
twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Many gained new access to education and the
right to vote. Many reduced their birth rate. It is possible to argue that some of the
key features of traditional patriarchal society were beginning to yield, and this was a
huge change in the human condition.
But there are complexities. Men sometimes retaliated. In certain areas, women’s
economic position worsened. High-sounding principles were often ignored. And
there was great regional variety in all aspects of women’s lives.
Documents in this section are organized into three sets. First, new international
conventions for women, strongly reflecting feminist ideas about rights, played a
genuine role in the process of change. Second, conditions of poor women in Mexico
and Kenya help test ideas about change and indicate some of the variety that
complicates the subject. Third, comments by educated women in India and Nigeria
raise questions about the nature and direction of change, and about the validity of
Western standards.
Some change is involved in all the materials presented; some of it even points in
similar directions, for example, in the area of birth control and education. But great
disparities show up as well, plus basic disputes about what directions change should
take.
Questions
1. What are the key elements of the global human rights approach to gender issues?
2. According to peasant women’s own statements, what aspects of village life and
expectations have been changing most rapidly for them? What aspects have
changed least?
3. What kinds of traditional values do women continue to express, even amid
change?
4. What is the relationship between global standards and the lives and changing
experiences of women in Kenya and Mexico? Were global rights statements
meaningful reflections of civilizations and changes in women’s lives?
5. What are the main differences, according to interview evidence, between the
situations and attitudes of Mexican and of African women? Are there differences
in relations with men in the two societies?
6. What are the problems surrounding birth control as an issue in rural society?
Were conditions in this regard significantly different in Africa and Mexico during
the 1970s?
7. Why does Madhu Kishwar praise arranged marriages?
8. What Nigerian traditions does Ifi Amadiume identify as particularly hard for
Western scholars to understand? What are her criteria for judging women’s
conditions?
9. Do Amadiume and Kishwar agree on some aspects of women’s goals in the West
that they find objectionable?

10. Do Amadiume and Kishwar agree on the directions of recent change? Which one
seems to have more confidence that things are still going well for women?
11. Do Amadiume and Kishwar share any attitudes with village women in Third
World societies? Which one suggests a clearer affiliation with upper-class status?
Which one emphasizes recent changes that might harm lower-class women?
For Further Discussion
1. What previous ideas and movements help explain the nature of the international
women’s rights agenda?
2. Judging by evidence from Mexico and Africa in the 1970s, have conditions for
women on the whole been improving or deteriorating? Is there a similar process
of “modernization” at work? How would a Western feminist judge the women’s
attitudes?
3. What are the advantages and limitations of interviewing as a source of evidence
for contemporary history? Are interviewees likely to slant their remarks at all?
What other evidence would help form a picture of women’s views and conditions
in late-twentieth-century Kenya and Mexico?
4. The evidence in Huston’s interviews comes from the 1970s. How much change
would you expect to have occurred, and in what directions, a quarter-century
later? Would you expect the same kinds of change in Mexico and in Kenya?
5. Would Amadiume criticize Huston’s approach as an example of Western bias
about the Third World?
6. Why might upper-class Indian and African women differ about the directions of
change in their societies in the twentieth century?
7. What is your evaluation of the relevance of Western feminist ideals to societies
like India or Africa?
8. Will global human rights principles increasingly define women’s lives?
FOURTH W ORLD CONFERENCE ON WOMEN
The United Nations began developing special “years” for women in 1965; each year
occasioned a major global conference and resounding proclamations of women’s
rights. These in turn helped spur changes in various national legislations and the
creation of nongovernment organizations in many places, from Africa to Latin
America, designed to further women’s rights. The following document emanated
from the major global conference of 1995, widely attended by women from all
regions, but particularly from outside Western Europe and the United States
•••
BEIJING DECLARATION (SEPTEMBER 1995)

We, the Governments participating in the Fourth World Conference on Women…
recognizing that the status of women has advanced in some important respects in
the past decade but that progress has been uneven, that inequalities between women
and men have persisted and major obstacles remain, with serious consequences for
the well-being of all people… and also recognizing that this situation is exacerbated
by the increasing poverty that is affecting the lives of the majority of the world’s
people, in particular women and children, with origins in both the national and
international domains, dedicate ourselves unreservedly to addressing these

constraints and obstacles and thus enhancing further the advancement and
empowerment of women all over the world, and agree that this requires urgent
action in the spirit of determination, hope, cooperation and solidarity, now and to
carry us forward into the next century.…
We are convinced that:
Women’s empowerment and their full participation on the basis of equality in all
spheres of society, including participation in the decision-making process and access
to power, are fundamental for the achievement of equality, development and peace;
Women’s rights are human rights; Equal rights, opportunities and access to
resources, equal sharing of responsibilities for the family by men and women, and a
harmonious partnership between them are critical to their well-being and that of
their families as well as to the consolidation of democracy; Eradication of poverty
based on sustained economic growth, social development, environmental protection
and social justice requires the involvement of women in economic and social
development, equal opportunities and the full and equal participation of women and
men as agents and beneficiaries of people-centered sustainable development; The
explicit recognition and reaffirmation of the right of all women to control all
aspects of their health, in particular their own fertility, is basic to their
empowerment; Local, national, regional and global peace is attainable and is
inextricably linked with the advancement of women, who are a fundamental force
for leadership, conflict resolution and the promotion of lasting peace at all levels; It
is essential to design, implement and monitor, with the full participation of women,
effective, efficient and mutually reinforcing gender-sensitive policies and
programmes, including development policies and programmes, at all levels that will
foster the empowerment and advancement of women.…
We are determined to:
Intensify efforts and actions to… ensure the full enjoyment by women and the girl
child of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and take effective action
against violations of these rights and freedoms; Take all necessary measures to
eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and the girl child and remove
all obstacles to gender equality and the advancement and empowerment of women;
Encourage men to participate fully in all actions towards equality; Promote women’s
economic independence, including employment, and eradicate the persistent and
increasing burden of poverty on women by addressing the structural causes of
poverty through changes uneconomic, ensuring equal access for all women,
including those in rural areas, as vital development agents, to productive resources,
opportunities and public services; Promote people-centered sustainable development,
including sustained economic growth, through the provision of basic education, lifelong education, literacy and training, and primary health care for girls and women;
Take positive steps to ensure peace for the advancement of women and, recognizing
the leading role that women have played in the peace movement, work actively
towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international
control, and support negotiations on the conclusion, without delay, of a universal
and multilaterally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty
which contributes to nuclear disarmament and the prevention of the proliferation of
nuclear weapons in all its aspects; Prevent and eliminate all forms of violence
against women and girls; Ensure equal access to and equal treatment of women and
men in education and health care and enhance women’s sexual and reproductive
health as well as education; Promote and protect all human rights of women and
girls; Intensify efforts to ensure equal enjoyment of all human rights and

fundamental freedoms for all women and girls who face multiple barriers to their
empowerment and advancement because of such factors as their race, age, language,
ethnicity, culture, religion, or disability, or because they are indigenous people;
Ensure respect for international law, including humanitarian law, in order to protect
women and girls in particular; Develop the fullest potential of girls and women of
all ages, ensure their full and equal participation in building a better world for all
and enhance their role in the development process.…
VILLAGE WOMEN
INTERVIEWS WITH MEXICAN PEASANT WOMEN IN THE 1970S

These interviews were conducted by an American anthropologist, Perdita Huston.
Huston was trained in ethnographic interview techniques, though in several cases
she had to rely on interpreters. She was also inspired by a feminist concern for
women’s issues, including cases of clear mistreatment. The women who speak out
here are from southern Mexico, many of them Indians.
•••
Interview with a Zapotec Indian

Maria Luisa spoke to me about her sister’s [Anna’s] life:
“She is in the process of breaking up with her husband. They have four children,
but they didn’t get married until the third child was born. Then the priest said, ‘If
you don’t get married, I’m not baptizing your children.’”
“Anna’s husband wants to live like the old men used to live—having women right
under his thumb—not the way it is today. Even our family is against it. They say,
‘He has such old-fashioned ideas.’ The woman has to be in the house. She has to
confess everything to him. She can’t have a thought of her own. Even that’s okay.
You can be jealous. You can even be a tyrant. But you have to do your share. You
have to bring in money. The reason the family is so down on him is not because he’s
a tyrant, but because he doesn’t fulfill his part of the marriage. She has to go out
and look for food while he’s gallivanting around. That’s what doesn’t make sense.
You know—rules are rules.”
“Now he’s beating her even more than before because his mother is constantly
filling his head with ideas. ‘Anna doesn’t cook good food,’ she says—and things like
that. He beats her up; she is black and blue on the thighs or on the back or wherever.
He says he has the right to rule. You know, the male doesn’t want to be made a fool
of. He accuses other men of being weak. He says, ‘I’m not like those men. I don’t let
women give orders in my house.’
“But Anna is a good wife. She works hard, and if he would let her out of the
house, their family would have more money. She works hard in the field, but he
doesn’t even give her money for food. Granted, he doesn’t really earn that much
himself, but he could. He could take crops into town and sell them and bring back
the money, but he doesn’t. He feels she shouldn’t have money. He works in the field,
but he doesn’t look for other work. So he gets very little. He doesn’t want to sell
much, and there is not enough money to feed the family, so Anna has to sell things
or borrow five pesos here and there. Then he gets enraged and blames her for not
managing.…
From Perdita Huston, Third World Women Speak Out (New York: Praeger Publishers,
1979), 41–42, 78–79, 82–83.

[On education, asked what she would have wanted to learn at school]: “I don’t
know what exactly, but it would have been something that would earn money. We
are very backward here and we don’t know anything. … the problem is that we
don’t know how to earn money.”
Interviews at a Birth Control Clinic

“They say terrible things about women who want to [practice birth control]. Some
say, ‘The only reason you want birth control is so you can go with other men.’ Once
the radio said, ‘Father of the family, if you want to give your children a good upbringing, take care of them well and remember that small families live better.’ Well,
my brother just laughed. You see, some people are very ignorant.”
“The only thing I don’t do is go to confession, because then I would have to
confess that I take the pill, and the priest would say, ‘Leave the church.’ I could still
go to mass, but he wouldn’t give me holy communion if I told about the pill.”…
“I went to school for a while, but the teacher didn’t come to school very often, so
we didn’t learn much. I guess I taught myself to read.”
“I have been married for four years. I have only these two children. The first is
three, the other almost a year.”…
“The main thing that makes the times different, I think, is the control women
have over the number of children in a family. A family can be planned now; it can
live a better life. Women have more facilities for everything because of this. I began
to take contraceptives when this last child was eight months old. I take the pill.”
“My husband wants a boy because these children are both girls; he doesn’t know
that I am taking the pill. He wants a boy and says that when I have one, then I can
use contraceptives. I want to wait at least two years so that this little girl is older.
Then I will try for the boy.”…
“For me, family planning is very important because my husband does not earn big
wages. For the moment, we just can’t afford more than two children.…
“I told you we were very poor when I was a child. We were six children, and my
father didn’t earn much. That is why I want just two or three children. I don’t want
my children to grow up like me—without an education. I feel very ashamed and bad
about not having any education. I want my children to go to school and learn many,
many things. I don’t want them to live by the rumors of the street. I want them to
learn for themselves. I want them to be independent and proud of themselves.”
INTERVIEWS WITH AFRICAN PEASANT WOMEN IN THE 1970S

In these selections, village women from Kenya provide most of the statements,
discussing their goals in the context of changes and continuities they saw around
them. Again, their statements can be compared with the judgments about rural life
by Kenyan professionals such as a doctor and a social worker.

A Great-Grandmother

I don’t really know my age, but I remember that I was married during the great war
[World War I]. In those days we lived all right—happily. Things were quite different
from what they are now. We got these clothes only recently. We used to wear
something from banana fibers just to cover our lower parts. It was scratchy, but we
were used to it. I think all the changes came when the churches came. We got our
clothing, and then we said we should cover our bodies and go to school—maybe go

to church.
“We had cows, goats, sheep, and hens. … Even the chickens didn’t get sick in
those days. These days, more people die than used to. We had no hospitals; we were
just sick, and if you knew any medicines, any herbs, you used them. There were
malaria, stomachaches, and backaches. But not many used to die. They lived to be
very old men and women. When you heard so-and-so was dead, everyone used to go,
because that was the only funeral in a long time.
“In those days, we also used to have old women who knew herbs and helped
women in childbirth and with their babies’ health. In the old days, even if you had
ten children you could care for them. You were happy because you had many little
girls and boys to be married, as well as many grandchildren. I had nine children;
three died as babies. They had diarrhea and just died. I don’t know why. Now
children don’t die as much any more because we have doctors and hospitals
nearby.”…
“What we need in this village is teachers to teach women handicrafts and sewing
and agricultural skills. We have organized a women’s group. I am one of the leaders.
We are saving up for a building to meet in. All women are trying to earn money, and
we want to have a building for our meetings. It will be called the ‘adult education
building’—with rooms for handicrafts, literacy, and other things.”
“We also want our children to be educated—so we can have good leaders to keep
our country good. I think now it is best to have only four children—so you can take
care of them.
“It is better to educate a girl than a boy, although one should educate both. Girls
are better. They help a lot. See this house? My daughters built it for me. If you don’t
have any daughters, who will build for you? The boys will marry and take care of
their wives—that’s all. They don’t care about mothers. For example, if my son gets
married, the daughter-in-law will say, ‘Let’s take our mothers to live with us.’ The
son will say, ‘No, we will just have our own family and do our own things.’ So you
are left alone. What do you do?”…
From Perdita Huston, Third World Women Speak Out (New York: Praeger Publishers,
1979), 12–13, 42–43, 72–73, 79–80.
“These days there is no trust. Men have defeated us. They don’t listen: they have
big heads. Before, we mixed with each other—men and women. There were no
differences between us. We trusted one another, but now men are not
straightforward. These are the changes taking place.”

“My mother has eleven children. She is my father’s only wife. She works in the fields
and grows the food we eat. She plants cabbage, spinach, and corn. She works very
hard, but with so many children it is difficult to get enough food or money. All of
my sisters and brothers go to school. One is already a teacher, and that is why I am
trying to learn a profession. If I can get enough schooling, I can serve the country
and my own family. I can also manage to have a life for myself. That is why I came
to this school. We have a big family, and I have to help.
“My life is very different from my mother’s. She just stayed in the family until she
married. Life is much more difficult now because everybody is dependent on money.
Long ago, money was unheard of. No one needed money. But now you can’t even
get food without cash. Times are very difficult. That is why the towns are creating

day-care centers—so women can work and have their own lives. I have to work, for
without it I will not have enough money for today’s life.
“These are the problems I face and try to think about. How shall I manage to pick
up this life so that I can live a better one? You know, we people of Kenya like to
serve our parents when they are still alive—to help the family. But first, women have
to get an education. Then if you get a large family and don’t know how to feed it—if
you don’t have enough money for food—you can find work and get some cash.
That’s what I will teach my children: ‘Get an education first.’” …
“If I had a chance to go to the university, I would learn more about health
education. I could help women that way. If I were in a position of authority. I would
really try to educate women. Right now, girls are left behind in education. It costs
money, and parents think it is more important to educate boys. But I think that if
people are intelligent, there is no difference. Girls and boys should be educated the
same.… And I would change the laws so that men would understand women and
their needs and not beat them as they do.
“I only hope that I will have a mature husband who will understand and discuss
things with me.”
A Leader of a Women’s Cooperative

“Most women don’t rely on their husbands now. If they get some money, well and
good; and if they don’t, they just try to get money for themselves—selling vegetables
or making and selling handicrafts.”
“Life is very difficult these days, and men are paying less attention to their wives.
You see, men have wrongly just taken advantage of having more money. Instead of
using money properly, to improve the lives of their families, they spend it on all the
‘facilities’ available at hotels. Instead of spending nights in their own homes, they
fight at home and seek women outside—in the hotels. Many men cheat on their
wives now because they are employed and have money. A husband can say, ‘I have
been sent as a driver to Nairobi’ (or elsewhere), when he actually spends the money
on girls.”
“So women are fed up. They think now that relying on a man can be a problem.
They say, ‘We should try to do something ourselves. Then, whether we get something
from our men or not, we still will be able to raise our children properly.’ The
problem that many women face is that they must become self-supporting. They
either have no support from their husbands at all, or very little. And there is no law
to protect them.”
“But women are trying to do something for themselves, and if they had the capital
they could establish businesses to help them make money. The main problem here is
the money problem. Many women are alone. They need to earn for their families.”…
“Women feel very hurt because they think their men don’t recognize them as
human beings. They are unhappy because of this inequality. I am lucky; my husband
is good. He never took another wife. We are still together.”…
Urban Family Planning Worker

“We get referrals from other workers. A nutritionist, for example, will come and tell
us that she visited a home and feels that the home needs advice on family planning.
So we go to the family and talk with them. We also go the child welfare clinic and
talk with mothers there. We find that some do not feel free to talk about their
problems there, so we go to their own homes and have further discussions. The

woman might say, “I’m willing to practice family planning, but my husband is
against it. I’ve tried to persuade him, but he has refused. So I don’t know whether
there is anything you can do for me.’” …
“Some say that they are able to care for their children—so they don’t see why
they should participate in family planning. Others say they don’t see why they
should plan their families, since the idea is not an African tradition but has been
brought in by Westerners. Also, some men fear that when a woman starts using
family planning, she is in that way exposed to the world and can go with any other
man, since she knows she won’t get pregnant. They don’t trust their wives.”…
…“Women fear medicines and they fear their husbands. There are a lot of fears,
and it will take much time to catch on.”…
“The men don’t understand that family planning is good because it gives the
woman time to rest between pregnancies. They don’t care much about that, or about
the condition of their children. You’ll never see a man going to a family planning
clinic. The men here believe: Let a woman be free of childbearing and she will go
everywhere. They want a woman to have a child every year until she becomes old,
while they are free to go gadding about. So if a woman doesn’t keep on having
children, her husband will get angry and take another wife.”
A Female Midwife

The poor health here is not a poverty problem. There is plenty of land. The problem
is the lack of knowledge about nutrition. That’s one thing that has to be learned. If
people knew how to utilize foods and what to plant to feed the children, it would be
better.…
“The nutritional problem is also due to some of the superstitions and taboos.
There are still many areas where people believe children should not eat eggs
because, they say, the children will never talk. You just have to keep persuading
people. When mothers realize that children who eat eggs do talk, they will convince
other mothers that their children will not be harmed by eggs. But you can’t force
them to suddenly change what they do. First I ask them to try other things that give
the same food nutrients as eggs. Women are not supposed to eat chicken either—
although the men do. It’s not fair.”
UPPER-CLASS AND SCHOLARLY VIEWS
INDIA: MADHU KISHWAR ON LOVE AND MARRIAGE

Madhu Kishwar is an Indian scholar who has written widely on family issues; the
next selection is from a magazine article by her on Indian and Western views of
marriage. She reflects the influence of Western ideas, from her own education and
from channels such as Hollywood films. But she relies more heavily on polling data
and the evaluation of traditional practices, which she juxtaposes with Western
models.
•••
The recent Eye-witness-MARG opinion poll conducted with 1,715 adults in the five
metropolitan cities reported in SUNDAY magazine’s 9–15 January 1994 issue that
74 percent of women and an almost equal proportion of men believe that arranged
marriages are more likely to succeed than love marriages. Almost 80 percent of
respondents felt that a young recently married couple—if they had a choice—should
live with their parents. That these opinions are not a mindless hangover of

“tradition” becomes evident as they report that over 90 percent of the same
respondents believed that men should help with household chores, and eighty
percent believed that, if they had one daughter and one son, they would leave an
equal amount to each in any Will that they made. These poll results are supportive
of some of my impressions gathered from talking to numerous young women,
including my own students, as to why most young women are not very enamoured
with “love” marriages.
From Madhu Kishwar, “Love and Marriage,” Manushi: A Journal about Women and
Society 80 (1994): II, 13–14, 18. Reprinted by permission of the author.
Feminists, socialists and other radicals often project the system of arranged
marriages as one of the key factors leading to women’s oppression in India. This
view derives from the West, which recognizes two supposedly polar opposite forms
of marriage—“love marriage” versus arranged marriage.…
Self-Arranged Marriages

Critics of the family arranged marriage system in India have rightly focused on how
prospective brides are humiliated by being endlessly displayed for approval when
marriages are being negotiated by families. The ritual of ladki dikhana, with the
inevitable rejections women (now even men) often undergo before being selected [is
part of this process].…
However, women do not really escape the pressures of displaying and parading
themselves in cultures where they are expected to have self-arranged marriages.
Witness the amount of effort a young woman in western societies has to put in to
look attractive enough to hook eligible young men. One gets the feeling they are on
constant self display as opposed to the periodic displays in family arranged
marriages. Western women have to diet to stay trim since it is not fashionable
nowadays to be fat, get artificial padding for their breasts (1.5 million American
women are reported to have gone through silicon surgery to get their breasts
reshaped or enlarged), try to get their complexion to glow, if not with real health, at
least with a cosmetic blush. They must also learn how to be viewed as “attractive”
and seductive to men, how to be a witty conversationalist as well as an ego booster
—in short, to become the kind of appendage a man would feel proud to have around
him. Needless to say, not all women manage to do all the above, though most drive
themselves crazy trying. Western women have to compete hard with each other in
order to hook a partner. And once having found him, they have to be alert to
prevent other women from snatching him.…
The humiliations western women have to go through, having first to grab a man,
and then to devise strategies to keep other women off him, is in many ways much
worse than what a woman in parent-arranged marriages has to go through. She does
not have to chase and hook men all by herself. Her father, her brother, her uncles
and aunts and the entire kunba join together to hunt for a man. In that sense the
woman concerned does not have to carry the burden of finding a husband all alone.
And given the relative stability of marriage among communities where families take
a lot of interest in keeping the marriage going, a woman is not so paranoid about
her husband abandoning her in favour of a more attractive woman. Consequently,
Indian women are not as desperate as their western counterparts to look for ever
youthful, trim and sexually attractive marriage partners.…
NIGERIA: IFI AMADIUME

Ifi Amadiume, a Nigerian scholar here studying a village in the Ibo (Igbo) territory

—the same part of Nigeria referred to by Chinua Achebe (ch. 28)—has published
widely on African gender and family traditions. From a locally prominent family,
she spent time as a student in the West, and from that experience she feels she
gained knowledge that she can apply to comparisons with Africa.
•••
When the 1960s and 1970s female academics and Western feminists began to attack
social anthropology, riding on the crest of the new wave of women’s studies, the
issues they took on were androcentrism and sexism. … The methods they adopted
indicated to Black women that White feminists were no less racist than the
patriarchs of social anthropology whom they were busy condemning for male bias.
They fantasized a measure of superiority over African and other Third World
women. Black women’s critique could not therefore be restricted to the male bias of
social anthropology and not challenge White women. Drawing their data from the
Third World, especially Africa, works on women produced in Europe and America
have shown White women’s unquestioning acceptance of anthropology’s racist
division of the world. In the debates in the West, the Third World supplied the ‘raw
data’ for random sampling, citation and illustration of points. It baffles African
women that Western academics and feminists feel no apprehension or disrespectful
trivialization in taking on all of Africa or, indeed, all the Third World in one book. It
is revealing that most such works have not been written by women from Third
World nations; they, instead, tend to write about their particular ethnic group, their
country or surrounding region.…
The flexibility of Igbo gender construction meant that gender was separate from
biological sex. Daughters could become sons and consequently male. Daughters and
women in general could be husbands to wives and consequently males in relation to
their wives, etc.…
From Ifi Amadiume, Male Daughters, Female Husbands. Gender and Sex in an
African Society (London: Zed Books, 1987), 3–4, 15, 89–90, 91, 132, 141. Reprinted
by permission of the publisher.
An insight into this remarkable gender system is crucial to the understanding and
appreciation of the political status women had in traditional Igbo societies and the
political choices open to them.…
It can, therefore, be claimed that the Igbo language, in comparison with English,
for example, has not built up rigid associations between certain adjectives or
attributes and gender subjects, nor certain objects and gender possessive pronouns.
The genderless word mmadu, humankind, applies to both sexes. There is no usage, as
there is in English, of the word ‘man’ to represent both sexes, neither is there the
cumbersome option of saying ‘he or she,’ ‘his or her,’ ‘him or her.’ In Igbo, O stands
for he, she and even it, a stands for the impersonal one, and nya for the imperative,
let him or her.
This linguistic system of few gender distinctions makes it possible to
conceptualize certain social roles as separate from sex and gender, hence the
possibility for either sex to fill the role.…
The use of these weapons of war must be understood in the context of polygynous
marriage and compound structure. Of course it was possible for a man to turn to
another wife when one wife refused to have sexual relations with him. The
important point here is that women lived separately. The fact that a wife did not
spend the night with her husband made it possible for her to use sexual refusal as a

weapon of war without running the risk of marital rape. This is not the case for
women in monogamous marriages who cling to the Christian idea of the sanctity
and sexual exclusiveness of their matrimonial beds. Western feminists are still
finding it difficult to have rape in marriage recognized as a legal offence.
Refusal of sexual compliance by a wife still proved effective even when a man
had sexual access to other wives. Such refusal implied defiance and denial of rights,
and was ultimately a challenge to a husband’s authority over his wife. The
customary solution was not for the man to take the law into his own hands; he had
the option of calling in other members of the family or appealing to the formal
patrilineage organizations.… Obviously the weapon of sexual denial was most
effective when used collectively, either by all the wives of a man, all the wives of a
patrilineage, or better still, all the women of Nnobi.
Indeed the earliest recorded mass protest movement by Igbo women was the
Nwaobiala—the dancing women’s movement of 1925. The basic demand of the
movement, which was dominated by elderly women, was the rejection of
Christianity and a return to traditional customs. Nnobi is mentioned as one of the
three towns where a military escort was sent to restore order, as women there burnt
the market, blocked the main road and piled refuse in the court house. Children
were withdrawn from school and the market was boycotted.…
Overwhelming evidence shows that women in Nnobi and in Igboland in general
were neither more comfortable nor more advantaged from an economic point of
view under colonialism. They had lost their grip on the control of liquid cash; men
had invaded the general market, and women were becoming helpless in their
personal relations with husbands. But, most important of all, pro-female institutions
were being eroded both by the church and the colonial administration.…
… [W]omen’s centrality in the production and sale of palm-oil and kernels in
traditional Nnobi society gave them a considerable advantage over their husbands.
The introduction of pioneer oil mills mechanized the whole process of extracting the
palm-oil and cracking the kernels. This, of course, meant a much higher oil yield
which necessitated bulk buying by the agents of the mills and the channelling of
most of the village’s palm fruit to the mills. The main centre of production was
therefore shifted from the family to the mills. At the same time, wives lost the near
monopoly they enjoyed in the traditional method of production and the independent
income they derived from it.… Instead of wives selling the palm-oil and keeping
some of the profits, husbands now sold direct to the oil mills or their agents, and
collected the money.

CHAPTER 34
GLOBAL CONSUMERISM AND ITS DISCONTENTS
One of the most striking developments of the past 120 years has been the emergence
and growing importance of new forms of consumerism in literally every part of the
world. Consumerism—an attachment to the process of acquiring and enjoying new
material objects one does not strictly need—is hardly a new phenomenon, but until
relatively recent times it was largely confined to the upper classes and sometimes
shunned even there in favor of purely customary group styles and/or religious
interests. Modern consumerism differs from past forms by becoming more important
in the lives of many people and by spreading well beyond the upper classes.
From the first, modern consumerism has involved global products and global
styles. Items like sugar, tea, and coffee were consumer pioneers as they spread to
Western Europe—and all involved importation from other parts of the world.
Chinese porcelain inspired a major consumer goods industry in eighteenth-century
England. In the nineteenth century “oriental” rugs and furnishings, coming mainly
from the Middle East, were all the rage in the West. In the twentieth century,
Western and Japanese products gained growing global attention, from music to
foods to toys to electronic gadgets. Consumer interests and “international” styles
seemed to bridge across many cultural and political divides, creating some new
types of comparisons in contemporary world history.
Despite its obvious importance, it is not easy to define what consumerism is or
why it proves so attractive. This is one of the challenges in interpreting the following
documents. At the same time, consumerism has long roused objections: it can be
seen as shallow; as foreign; as disruptive of proper values; as negating appropriate
social hierarchies. Global consumerism also remains quite uneven: more available by
far to urban than to rural people, to industrialized than to developing economies,
even to young as opposed to older. Analyzing documents and comparing their
meanings can help identify not only why consumerism has become such a prominent
force but also why it has not swept everyone along in its path.
Questions
1. What are some of the major features of global consumerism? Do the Internet
documents suggest the same kind of consumerism, or somewhat different
approaches and interests?
2. Why does global consumerism find a greater audience among youth than among
older people?
3. What is the relationship between global consumerism and Americanization?
4. What are some of the key objections to global consumerism, and from what kinds
of people do they emanate?
5. How does consumerism figure into protests against “globalization”?
6. What issues are involved in interpreting the global role of a chain like
McDonald’s?
For Further Discussion
1. Does successful consumerism increase human happiness? If not, how can one
explain why it attracts so much participation?

2. Are protests against global consumerism likely to gain ground?
3. Are some parts of the world more open to global consumerism than others?
4. How does the analysis of global consumerism relate to larger issues in world
history?
C ONSUMERISM ON THE INTERNET
The following documents come from 2004 sites on the Internet.
A MICHAEL JACKSON FAN IN SLOVENIA
TANJA KOVAC (A 23-YEAR-OLD FINANCIAL ASSISTANT): The first time I heard a Michael Jackson

song was way back in 1987. It was the time when Michael was on his world tour for
BAD. I was just 7 years old and I only knew Michael by the way he looks. When I
first became his fan I didn’t even know that he was a singer. I just came into my
sister’s room and saw a poster of him on the wall and my eyes immediately turned
to him. I remember asking my sister who this man was and my mouth was just wide
open. I just couldn’t believe that one man could look so beautiful. A week after that
I heard the whole BAD album when my sister brought it home so I could hear it. I
guess my very first song by Michael was BAD since that’s the first song on the
album. When I heard it I fell in love with him even more. He just has it all: the
looks, the voice and such a wonderful character. I remember being very much in
shock over his whole image and music.
From: http://carniola.org/theglory/2004/04/tanja_kovac_mic.html.
TGOC: What’s in your current Michael Jackson collection?
TANJA: I have a large collection of Michael Jackson memorabilia. There are so
many MJ things that people don’t even know exist. I have all of his albums, singles,
vinyls, picture discs, special edition discs, his rare mixes and tapes, Jackson 5 and
The Jacksons albums… all about his music. Then I have so many of his books,
magazines (from all over the world), song books, calendars, notebooks, PVC bags
with MJ on it, puzzles, MJ perfumes, sculptures, badges, stickers, over 1500 of his
original photos, over 100 videocassettes of rare footage of Michael Jackson, pillows,
poster, promotional posters, tour books, flags, caps, Mystery drink cans, MJ dolls
(which sing the Black or White song), T-shirts, Billie Jean glove, hats (one of them
was touched by Michael himself), DVD’s, concert tickets, original History tour bag.
… My most special items are two Michael Jackson autographs that I got when I
went to see Michael live (Berlin and London). I made a tattoo on my right arm of
one of the autographs.
TGOC: Tell me about the tattoo. Do you have any more—or are you planning on
more?
TANJA: I always wanted to have a MJ tattoo and this dream came true for me just
two days after I met Micahel in Harrods, London. It was in June 2002. First I wanted
to make a tattoo of Michael’s face but since I didn’t have enough money to do that, I
decided it would be best to make a tattoo of a MJ autograph that my boyfriend got
from Michael personally just a few days before. Everyone who saw it till this day has
said it looks amazing, I’ve never heard anyone say anything bad about it. Yes, I plan
to do more of them. I want a tattoo of Michael’s face and I believe I will get it done
soon.
TGOC: Does your boyfriend ever get jealous of your love for Michael Jackson?

TANJA: No. My boyfriend never gets jealous of my GIGANTIC love for Michael. He

was even with me when I got the chance to meet Michael and didn’t mind that I
kissed Michael’s hand. My boyfriend is a Michael Jackson fan as well.
TGOC: Is it difficult, as a fan, to watch what’s happening to MJ now? How do you
know he is innocent? And what would you say to people who already think he’s
guilty?
TANJA: Yes it is painful to see what is happening to him now. I cannot believe that
people can be so mean and cruel to make such an injustice against him just because
of money. It breaks my heart to see him in pain and I want this injustice to end very
soon. I organized a vigil—support event here in Ljubljana to show all Slovenian
people that Michael is being framed. Fans cam from all over Slovenia and even
Croatia and Bosnia and together we talked to people about the truth of these
allegations. We spread leaflets with information and gave Michael all our support.
Everyone had a banner with them saying: “Michael is INNOCENT” and some MJ
items like hats, gloves, T-shirts, posters; I made a webpage call JMSlo.com where I
inform people about all the news that is happening with Micahel Jackson now. I
translate the news from English to Slovenian so people can get the right information.
I was sick and tired of reading false stories about Michael in our newspapers and
that’s why I decided to do MJSlo.com.
You ask me how I know that Michael is innocent? I have been a Michael Jackson
fan for 17 years already and through the years I have lived and breathed Michael
Jackson. I got to know him through his interviews, shows, rare footage that I have of
him, private recordings, I got to meet him live six times and talk to him, and
through all these years I have seen whatta man he is. He has a great heart and a
brilliant mind and I tell you there is NO WAY Michael ever did what they accuse
him of. Everyone who knows Michael personally says the same. That’s just not in
Michael’s heart, he could not even think of that. It’s people with sick minds that
think like that. He is totally Innocent of any wrong doing.
To the people who already think he is guilty I would like to quote Michael’s
saying “Don’t judge a man until you have walked in his moccasins for two weeks.”
Get the right information about these allegations, please visit MJSlo.com and read
the truth about Michael Jackson and his life! If that’s still not enough for you wait
and hear the truth in court. Lies run sprints, truth runs marathons. The truth will win
this marathon!!
MCDONALD’S AND LOVE IN CHINA

From: http://www.livinginchina.copm/archives/00690.html.
He ate so little, as the two of them say knees touching, eyes on each other, oblivious
to those who shared their four-foot oval dining table. I sat uncomfortably on the
child-sized seat directly across from the lovers, my knees banging against the table
with each bit of my big Mac. The 30-something father with his three-year-old son
munched noisily through a happy meal, slurping on their drinks, and playing with
the Nemo toy. A voyeur, I watch the lovers eat and speak the language of love. A
year in China has erased some of my initial discomfort when forced to invade
personal space. Ten months ago my eyes would have remained on my food tray,
attempting to decipher the symbols and Mandarin characters describing McDonald’s
newest advertising scheme. On this day, however, I sat transfixed by the scene a
mere two feet before me. The university-aged lovers (a word the Chinese apply to
boyfriend/girlfriend) shared a small hot tea, which remained capped and unopened,

an order of spicy McWings, a fish sandwich, and small fries. The woman was
feasting on the chicken wing morsels; the man was feasting on the woman. He
frequently stroked her long, dark hair, placing it behind her right shoulder. Both her
hands were full of food, his remained free to assist her in opening cartons, peeling
the paper from her sandwich. Leaning into each other, they were merely a burger
distance apart as he fed her fries. I could have been on the moon. I don’t understand
Putonghua, literally common speech, however, I like to think I have slightly more
success in people-watching than most. Attempting to match non-verbal
communication with words I hear repeatedly, I manage life quite well in China.
Besides, I was also once in love. The woman, abandoning the spicy wings and
delicately picking up the fish sandwich (careful to keep it encased in its paper
wrapper), spoke excitedly about some event. Gesture free, her rich voice, full of
inflection, pauses, and excited, high tones caused the young man to maintain
sustained eye contact, a thin mouth alternating between a shy smile and despairing
frown. I watched him raise his eyebrows in amazement, and, finally, to laugh freely
at her completed story. She took the last bite of a shared sandwich that he’d not
touched. He picked up a nude French fry, offering it first to her before licking the
salt. The tea, apparently forgotten and unattended, was getting cold. Chicken bones
lay discarded in a tiny heap next to the crumpled fish wrapper and unused ketchup
packages. I found myself part of a threesome. No longer aware of the little boy
sitting on the fixed stool next to me making swimming noises with his cheeseburger
and Nemo, I was swimming in love. The turquoise scarf she wore shimmered under
the fluorescent light. The brown sweater he wore over layers of shirts added strength
and maturity to his lean frame. Her petite cell phone hung from a red cord around
her neck, resting halfway down her chest. His phone shared table space with their
food tray. Neither stopped their look of love to send text messages to anyone.
Western university students eat on-the-run at McDonald’s. Their Chinese counterparts
eat at McDonald’s with special friends or lovers—a date place. Expensive, by Chinese
standards, western-modern, and food for the soul—not one’s health—is the draw. A
safe, public place where diners are definitely still part of a crowd, yet easy for two
people in love to carve a privacy zone just for their pleasure. Finishing the last of my
ketchup dressed fires (yes, they taste the same as in the US), I gathered my trash,
wiped my hands on a rare napkin, and picked up my backpack. No need to say
good-by to my dining companions; tacit acknowledgement of my existence had
never occurred. I could have stolen their last French fry.

I guess it’s so romantic, though I can’t completely understand the words and

Being a Chinese boy, I have read the lovely story for three times. I wish same story
in my life.
Posted by Fuwei 03/31/04
A beautiful story. I see a bigger picture involved here. The much needed privacy for
young lovers in an eating place. That’s quite an achievement. I remember when I
was still dating with my wife we had a tough time finding a private place for two
young lovers. This was 5–6 years back in Hyderabad, India. Things have changed in
India too now, the present crop of young lovers do not care much and there are
more of them now so the number of places are increasing. Anyway, thanks for the
lovely story. Suhit

GLOBAL WEB POSTINGS BY AMERICANS

I’m starting to think there are two kinds of “world cultural product.” There’s driveby tourism stuff, that gets picked up from local scenes by global entrepreneurs, like,
say the Tuareg singers at “Festival in the Desert.”

Four CD’s I listen to a lot (all a few years old now): Rachid Taha’s *Medina*,
Hedningarna’s *Karelia Visa* (Finnish folk-inspired trance-y music), the Amores
Perros soundtrack, *Mundial Muzique* (a sampler of new Brazillian lounge-y stuff)

“Cibelle’s mentor, Suba, was Servian. Cibelle sings in Portuguese and English, and
currently lives and performs in London. Because Cibelle is a “Young World Diva.” I
didn’t realize that “Young World Divas” existed until about 45 seconds ago, but you
may rely upon it that I am intensely and persistently interested…”
And then there’s product like Cibelle, which is originally made by a multinational
globalized polyglot diaspora.
Number one is generally better art, but number two is a lot more interesting.

A while back, a Turkish coworker lent me a CD by Turkish female singer songwriter
name Nazan Ocel. I though it kicked serious ass. I have been trying to get a copy of
this disk for 6 years now. It’s been my hope that the shrinking world and increasing
cultural cross-pollination would mean that I can get the rocking disks like this from
other countries. I’d love to have some musical Marco Polo Leighton doing that with
the Tuvan music, but I’d like to be able to get lots of the local music from around
the world. Is anyone doing this now?
Posted by Dave Slusher at December 5, 2003 06:57 PM
I’m thinking there’s a third kind of “world cultural product,” somewhere between
the first two: derivative of things from elsewhere than the place where it was made,
constructed for a specifically local audience, but also effective in a more global way
(sometimes with the aid of time). Example that comes to mind: the Ethiopiques
series of CDs, compiling records that came out on the tiny Ethiopian label Amha in
the early 70s—half their bloodline is from traditional pentatonic music, half is from

ANTI-GLOBALIZATION PROTEST IN SEATTLE
In December 1999 a series of protests rocked Seattle on the occasion of a World
Trade Organization meeting designed to discuss tariff reductions and the promotion
of global trade. The following passage was written by Jeffrey St. Clair, a radical
journalist and coeditor of the political newsletter Counterpunch. The Seattle protests
foreshadowed a regular series of protests against the WTO, the World Bank, and
other global organizations.

•••
And the revolution will be started by: sea turtles. At noon about 2,000 people
massed at the United Methodist Church, the HQ of the grassroots [organizations],
for a march to convention center. It was Environment Day and the Earth Island
Institute had prepared more than 500 sea turtle costumes for marchers to wear. The
sea turtle became the prime symbol of the WTO’s threats to environmental laws
when a WTO tribunal ruled that the U.S. Endangered Species Act, which requires
shrimp to be caught with turtle excluder devices, was an unfair trade barrier.
But the environmentalists weren’t the only ones on the street Monday morning. In
the first showing of a new solidarity, labor union members from the Steelworkers
and the Longshoremen showed up to join the march. In fact, Steelworker Don Kegley
led the march, alongside environmentalist Ben White. (White was later clubbed in
the back of the head by a young man who was apparently angry that he couldn’t do
his Christmas shopping. The police pulled the youth away from White, but the man
wasn’t arrested. White played down the incident.) The throng of sea turtles and bluejacketed union folk took off to the rhythm of a familiar chant that would echo down
the streets of Seattle for days: “The people will never be divided!”
From Alexander Cockburn, Jeffrey St. Clair, and Alan Sekula, Five Days That Shook
the World (London: Verso, 2000), 16–21.
I walked next to Brad Spann, a Longshoreman from Tacoma, who hoisted up one
of my favorite signs of the entire week: “Teamsters and Turtles Together at last!”
Brad winked at me and said, “What the hell do you think old Hoffa [former
Teamster leader] thinks of that?”
The march, which was too fast and courteous for my taste, was escorted by
motorcycle police and ended essentially in a cage, a protest pen next to a
construction site near the convention center. A large stage had been erected there
hours earlier and Carl Pope, the director of the Sierra Club, was called forth to give
the opening speech. The Club is the nation’s most venerable environmental group.…
Standing near the stage I saw Brent Blackwelder, the head of Friends of the Earth.
Behind his glasses and somewhat shambling manner, Blackwelder looks ever so
professional. And he is by far the smartest of the environmenta CEOs. But he is also
the most radical politically, the most willing to challenge the tired complacency of
his fellow green executive.…
After the speechifying most of the marchers headed back to the church. But a
contingent of about 200 ended up in front of McDonald’s where a group of French
farmers had mustered to denounce U.S. policy on biotech foods. Their leader was
José Bove, a sheep farmer from Millau in southwest France and a leader of
Confederation Paysanne, a French environmental group. In August, Bove had been
jailed in France for leading a raid on a McDonald’s restaurant under construction in
Larzac. At the time, he was already awaiting charges that he destroyed a cache of
Novartis’ genetically engineered corn. Bove said his raid on the Larzac McDonald’s
was promoted by the U.S. decision to impose a heavy tariff on Roquefort cheese in
retaliation for the European Union’s refusal to import American hormone-treated
beef. Bove’s act of defiance earned him the praise of Jacques Chirac and Friends of
the Earth. Bove said he was prepared to start a militant worldwide campaign against
“Frankenstein” foods. “These actions will only stop when this mad logic comes to a
halt,” Bove said. “I don’t demand clemency but justice.”
Bove showed up at the Seattle McDonald’s with rounds of Roquefort cheese,

which he handed out to the crowd. After listening to a rousing speech against the
evils of Monsanto, and its bovine growth hormone and RoundupReady Soybeans, the
crowd stormed the McDonald’s breaking its windows and urging customers and
workers to join the marchers on the streets. This was the first shot in the battle for
Seattle.
Who were these direct action warriors on the front lines? Earth First, the Alliance
for Sustainable Jobs and the Environment (the new enviro-steelworker alliance), the
Ruckus Society (a direct action training center), Jobs with Justice, Rainforest Action
Network, Food Not Bombs, Global Exchange, and a small contingent of Anarchists,
the dreaded Black Bloc.
There was also a robust international contingent on the streets Tuesday morning:
French farmers, Korean greens [environmentalists], Canadian wheat growers,
Mexican environmentalists, Chinese dissidents, Ecuadorian anti-dam organizers,
U’wa tribes-people from the Columbian rainforest, and British campaigners against
genetically modified foods. Indeed earlier, a group of Brits had cornered two
Monsanto lobbyists behind an abandoned truck carrying an ad for the Financial
Times. They detained the corporate flacks long enough to deliver a stern warning
about the threat of franken-crops to wildlife, such as the Monarch butterfly. Then a
wave of tear gas wafted over them and the Monsanto men fled, covering their eyes
with their neckties.
Around 12:30 someone smashed the first storefront window. It could have been
an anarchist. It could have been an agent provocateur or stray bullet or concussion
grenade. What’s clear, though, is that the vandalism—what there was of it—started
more than two hours after the cops had attacked nonviolent protesters amassed at
6th and Union; protesters who had offered themselves up for arrest. At most, the
dreaded Black Bloc, which was to become demonized by the press and some of the
more staid leaders of labor and green groups, amounted to 50 people, many of them
young women. Much of the so-called looting that took place was done not by the
Anarchists, but by Seattle street gangs.
As the march turned up toward the Sheraton and was beaten back by cops on
horses, I teamed up with Etienne Vernet and Ronnie Cumming. Cumming is the head
of one of the feistiest groups in the U.S., the Pure Food Campaign, Monsanto’s chief
pain in the ass. Cumming hails from the oil town of Port Arthur, Texas. He went to
Cambridge with another great foe of industrial agriculture, Prince Charles. Cumming
was a civil rights organizer in Houston during the mid-sixties. “The energy here is
incredible,” Cumming said. “Black and white, labor and green, Americans,
Europeans, Africans, and Asians arm in arm. It’s the most hopeful I’ve felt since the
height of the civil rights movement.
Vernet lives in Paris, where he is the leader of the radical green group EcoRopa.
At that very moment the European delegates inside the convention were capitulating
on a key issue: The EU, which had banned import of genetically engineered crops
and hormone-treated beef, had agreed to a U.S. proposal to establish a scientific
committee to evaluate the health and environmental risks of biotech foods, a sure
first step toward undermining the moratorium. Still Vernet was in a jolly mood,
lively and invigorated, if a little bemused by the decorous nature of the crowd.
“Americans seem to have been out of practice in these things,” he told me.
“Everyone’s so polite. The only things on fire are dumpsters filled with refuse.” He
pointed to a shiny black Lexus parked on Pine Street, which throngs of protesters
had scrupulously avoided. In the windshield was a placard identifying it as

belonging to a WTO delegate. “In Paris that car would be burning.”
AMERICANISM AND CONSUMERISM
The following passage comes from Adbusters Magazine, in 2006. It reflects the
decline of the United States in world opinion, after the invasion of Iraq and other
developments, and offers an interesting opportunity to look at the relationship
between world opinion and consumerism and to examine corporate strategies to
deal with new complexities in the global market.
•••
A marketing study released early this year puts a pretty savage point on the
dilemma. Based on research conducted in the summer of 2005, Chicago branding
agency Energy BBDO ranked the “likeability” of 54 globally-marketed brands
amongst 13 to 18 years olds from a bakers dozen of countries, including the United
States.
Of the big brands with roots in the USA, just five—Nike, Colgate, Coca-Cola,
M&Ms and Kodak—made it into the top ten. Contrast this with ten years ago, when
a comparable study conducted by D’Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles discovered neartotal supremacy of US brands over the much-desired teen demographic, capturing
eight of the top ten “likeability” slots.
It’s clear that name recognition is not to blame for the decline. In the new study,
McDonalds ranked second for name recognition, respectively, yet not even breaking
the top twenty for likeability.
“An association with the US seemed to be a drag on the likeability of brands,
despite high logo recognition,” noted Chip Walker, executive vice president at
Energy BBDO, in a January interview with Women’s Wear Daily. “There seems to be
a great ambivalence towards America among global teens.”
While none of this spells out-and-out doom for US brands, being forced to stop
drinking from the poisoned well has left marketers scrambling to uncover new
formulas for generating teen cool.
Of the US entries in the current top ten, Nike has perhaps been the most
aggressive in shedding its mantle of Americana in favor of “localizing” itself across
the world. Hence the ongoing Joga Bonito (Play Beautiful) campaign, featuring the
likes of Brazilian footballer Ronaldnho Gaúcho and the retired French icon Eric
Cantona.
From Clayton Dach, “Global Teens Growing Indifferent to ‘Brand America,’”
Adbusters Magazine,
http://www.adbusters.org/the_magazine/66/Global_Teens_Growing.
Hence, also, Nike’s move to acquire other brands that already enjoy local cache—as
with Canadian hockey-equipment manufacturer Bauer, now Nike Bauer—or its new,
$43-million sponsorship deal with India’s national cricket team.
In a roundabout way, then, it may be tempting to prophesy that the Brand
America crisis could ultimately be a boon to those US brands that have been
coasting on borrowed cool, obliging them to fabricate more resilient, bespoke
identities that are better suited to emerging markets.
Tempting, yes, but likely also a tad hasty, given another major finding of the
Energy BBDO study. “Marketers facing big trouble,” note the study’s authors, “62
percent of global teens are apathetic about marketing and advertising. That is, they

are not anti-brand, but perhaps more dangerously, they just don’t care—don’t care
about wearing brand logos, don’t believe advertising, and feel there is too much
advertising in the world.”
This isn’t a small matter of a few errant kids. The global teen market is huge and
growing—in 2002, worth approximately $170 billion in the States alone. More
trenchantly, adolescence is regarded as the ideal moment to begin cultivating
“positive consideration” and brand loyalty, right at the moment when kids begin to
make independent purchasing decisions. No wonder, then, that the specter of a
disinterested, brand-apathetic teen is to a marketer what root rot is to a gardener: a
sign of trouble, “dangerous” things to come.
Comments
I for one, speaking as a 17 year old, can understand being completely indifferent to
brands. I work for minimum wage, and what I do with my money is strongly
weighted on price as well as smart consumerism. I think that habit will only be
solidified as I grow older. Why save my money for an overpriced piece of designer
clothing made in a sweatshop when I can buy cheaper, higher quality goods from a
local source? Vance
I would love to think that US branding is on its way out, however, branding has
proven to reinvent itself time and time again. Has anyone else ever heard of
consumers being compared to roaches? Eventually, the consumer is so oversaturated
with advertising that the cooperations will find more and more invasive ways to
spray the consumer with their poison. If we are not careful, we will all end up living
corporately sponsored lives. A gross exaggeration of what is slowly happening.
Hilde
I understand how teenage apathy could deteriorate the profits of various brand
names. However, is not a move away from exasperated consumerism and American
domination a positive thing? If teenagers are buying what they like and what is
functional and attracts them despite the brand name isn’t market competition
becoming more legitimate and less blind?
Sara
It is sad but true. After spending 17 years in the US, I came back to Pakistan. During
my teen days, everyone wanted to go to the US for education but now 90% want to
go to UK or Australia. If you ask them why, most of the time there is same answer.
Culturally US has gone backwards and they have alienated themselves.
Usman
Many Americans already live branded lives: their clothing, personal grooming
products, automobiles, and even speech habits (vocabulary, phrasing, etc.) and
dietary practices are influenced heavily by what they see on television. How many
times have I heard “talk to the hand,” “take it to the next level,” and “been there,
done that, got the t-shirt,” all of which appear to be the common tongue of talk
show hosts like Oprah, etc?
Jon Koppenhoefer
I know things are different in China. Young people like big brands much more than
others. Megalopolis culture holds that one lives better than other people through
“excellence” brands.
Zhaisi

I find myself hating many of the brands on that list. I’ve found that brands with
recognition, like Sony and the like, skimp on any kind of quality in their products.
Liking a big brand doesn’t set you apart from anyone and create individuality, but
finding a little no-name with great products gives you identity.
Garrett
The truth is, even though American brands are falling out of favor, European and
Asian consumerist brands will just pick up the slack. The news is an indicator of the
decline in America’s appeal—but it is not warming news about the reduction of
consumerism.
E.J.
I bet I can guess why Colgate is high on the list. I think it’s because of the tooth
whitening stuff. But yea, I’ve always disliked wearing stuff with brandnames on
display I just don’t find it very stylish and the thinking that things are cooler just
because what brand they are. I still don’t have an Ipod, or a cell phone. But I don’t
really care! I get them when I need them, or have enough money. Also, ditto on the
comment about how brands trying too hard is unattractive. I saw a commercial for
Nike in the movies and it was about getting more air. Like I’m gonna fly if I wear
those.
BLF
Some states in India just banned Coke and Pepsi products because they contain
pesticides, 24x higher than the agreed limit. This will accelerate their brand
deterioration outside of the US.
Chad
I completely agree on the strong anti-American trend with teens at the moment, but
I think that most teens do not really think about which country the company they
are buying is rooted. Although this does exclude some of the largest companies that
are very well known for having US roots (e.g. Nike, McDonalds, Coca-Cola, etc.).

CHAPTER 35
TERRORISM AND ANTI-TERRORISM
The final decades of the twentieth century were filled with periodic encounters with
terrorism. These spilled over, massively, to the twenty-first century when on
September 11, 2001, nineteen terrorists commandeered four commercial airplanes in
the United States and flew three of them into landmark buildings, the World Trade
Center in New York and the Pentagon near Washington, DC. Approximately three
thousand people died.
Along with globalization, terrorism becomes a central world history topic after
the end of the Cold War. It raises huge questions about relationships among major
civilizations, and it complicates any definition of globalization.
Terrorism is not easy to define or explain. It often involves violence by groups
who believe their cause is just but who face opposition from a superior force. It
often targets civilians, using modern technologies such as car bombs or hijacked
airplanes. The most widespread terrorism in the early twenty-first century emanated
from extremist Muslim groups protesting Western activities in the Middle East,
including Israeli treatment of Palestinians. While some Western leaders simply
condemned terrorism, others, while also condemning criminal tactics, urged an
understanding of the motives involved as part of mounting opposition strategies.
The six passages that follow invite several kinds of comparison. The first is
obvious: the huge differences in viewpoint between those who advocate terror and
Western leaders who oppose it. What are the key premises in both camps? How do
the assumptions of one group help explain those of the other? The second
comparison, still involving the two camps, asks whether there are differences of
approach within them—between British and American leaders or between self-styled
terrorist leaders and those who carry out attacks directly. Finally, the third cluster of
two documents explores positions of groups in the middle—opposed to terrorism but
also concerned about excesses in response. Comparing this approach to the two
more extreme camps raises the more subtle comparative question of whether any
middle way is possible.
Questions
1. What was bin Laden’s interpretation of Islam? How did he justify violence against
the United States?
2. What were the emphases of the 9/11 terrorists? How do they compare to bin
Laden’s approach?
3. How can international terrorism best be defined? Why do some people find a
definition difficult?
4. What were Tony Blair’s main arguments against terrorism? What strategy does he
suggest? How does his approach compare with that of President Bush?
5. How did the U.N. react to terrorism? What difficulties did it have in taking out a
clear position?
6. How does Ramadan’s argument compare to the definitions of Islam by bin Laden
and the terrorists? To the arguments at Blair and Bush?
7. Is it possible to think of a settlement between the extremes where terrorism is

involved?
For Further Discussion
1. Will terrorism and the struggle against it be the dominant issue of the twenty-first
century?
OSAMA BIN LADEN’S DECREE AND THOUGHTS BY 9/11 TERRORISTS
The first document is a 1998 fatwa, or decree, by Osama bin Laden, the leader of the
al Qaeda terrorist group; it was widely publicized. The second document is a letter
left by several of the hijackers of the 9/11 flights, according to the U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation; the Los Angles Times published a translation on September
29, 2001.
•••
OSAMA BIN LADEN’S DECREE

The Arabian Peninsula has never—since God made it flat, created its desert, and
encircled it with seas—been stormed by any forces like the crusader armies
spreading in it like locusts, eating its riches and wiping out its plantations. All this is
happening at a time in which nations are attacking Muslims like people fighting over
a plate of food. In the light of the grave situation and the lack of support, we and
you are obliged to discuss current events, and we should all agree on how to settle
the matter.
No one argues today about facts that are known to everyone; we will list them, in
order to remind everyone:
[For example], for over seven years the United States has been occupying the
lands of Islam in the holiest places, the Arabian Peninsula, plundering its riches,
dictating to its rulers, humiliating its people, terrorizing its neighbors, and turning
its basis in the Peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring
Muslim peoples.
All these crimes and sins committed by the Americans are a clear declaration of
war on God, his messenger, and Muslims. And ulema have throughout Islamic
history unanimously agreed that the Jihad is an individual duty if the enemy
destroys the Muslim countries. This was revealed by Imam Bin-Qadamah in “AlMughni,” Imam al-Kisai in “Al-Badai,” al-Qurtubi in his interpretation, and the
shaykh of al-Islam in his books, where he said: “As for the fighting to repulse [an
enemy], it is aimed at defending sanctity and religion, and it is a duty as agreed [by
the ulema]. Nothing is more sacred than belief except repulsing an enemy who is
attacking religion and life.”
On that basis, and in compliance with God’s order, we issue the following fatwa
to all Muslims:
The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies—civilians and military—is an
individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible
to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque [Mecca] from
their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam,
defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in accordance with the words of
Almighty God, “and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together,” and
“fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and
faith in God.”

Thoughts by 9/11 Terrorists
When you board the plane, remember that this is a battle in the sake of God, which
is worth the whole world and all that is in it. As the Messenger (peace and blessings
be upon him) has said.
When you sit in your seat, invoke the known supplications, and then be confident
with the remembrance of God. “O you who believe, if you meet an army, then stand
firm and invoke God much so that you may prosper.”
And know that the Gardens of Paradise are beautified with its best ornaments,
and its inhabitants are calling you. And if… do not let differences come between
you, and listen and obey, and if you kill, then kill completely, because this is the
way of the Chosen One.
On condition that… there is something greater than paying attention to the
enemy or attacking him, because the harm in this is much greater. For the priority of
the action of the group is much more important, since this is the duty of your
mission. Don’t take revenge for yourself only, but make your strike and everything
on the basis of doing it for the sake of God.
PRIME MINISTER BLAIR’S SPEECH AND PRESIDENT BUSH’S SPEECH
The first document below is from an October 2, 2001, speech by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, shortly before his nation joined the United States in an attack
on Afghanistan as the center of terrorist activities. The second document is from the
February 2002 State of the Union address by President George W. Bush, delivered
shortly after the radical Islamic regime in Afghanistan had been defeated; this was
the speech in which the president not only attacked terrorists but also condemned
Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as an “axis of evil” because their weapons threatened the
United States.
•••
BLAIR’S SPEECH

So, what do we do?
Don’t overreact some say. We aren’t
We haven’t lashed out. No missiles on the first night just for effect.
Don’t kill innocent people. We are not the ones who waged war on the innocent.
We seek the guilty.
Look for a diplomatic solution. There is no diplomacy with Bin Laden or the
Taliban regime.
State an ultimatum and get their response. We stated the ultimatum; they haven’t
responded.
Understand the causes of terror. Yes, we should try, but let there be no moral
ambiguity about this: nothing could ever justify the events of 11 September, and it is
to turn justice on its head to pretend it could.
The action we take will be proportionate; targeted, we will do all we humanly can
to avoid civilian casualties. But understand what we are dealing with. Listen to the
calls of those passengers on the planes. Think of the children on them, told they
were going to die.
There is no compromise possible with such people, no meeting of minds, no point

of understanding with such terror.
Just a choice: defeat it or be defeated by it. And defeat it we must.
When we act to bring to account those that committed the atrocity of September
11, we do so, not out of bloodlust.
We do so because it is just. We do not act against Islam. The true followers of
Islam are our brothers and sisters in this struggle. Bin Laden is no more obedient to
the proper teaching of the Koran than those Crusaders of the 12th century who
pillaged and murdered, represented the teaching of the Gospel.
It is time the west confronted its ignorance of Islam. Jews, Muslims and Christians
are all children of Abraham.
This is the moment to bring the faiths closer together in understanding of our
common values and heritage, a source of unity and strength.
So I believe this is a fight for freedom. And I want to make it a fight for justice
too. Justice not only to punish the guilty. But justice to bring those same values of
democracy and freedom to people round the world.
BUSH’S SPEECH

Our cause is just, and it continues. We have seen the depth of our enemies’ hatred in
videos, where they laugh about the loss of innocent life. And the depth of our
enemies’ hatred is equaled by the madness of the destruction they design. [In
Afghanistan] we have found diagrams of American nuclear power plants and public
water facilities, detailed instructions for making chemical weapons, surveillance
maps of American cities, and thorough descriptions of landmarks in America and
throughout the world What we have found confirms that, far from ending, our war
against terror is only beginning. Most of the 19 men who hijacked planes on
September the 11th were trained in Afghanistan’s camps, and so were tens of
thousands of others. Thousands of dangerous killers, schooled in the methods of
murder, often supported by outlaw regimes, are now spread throughout the world
like ticking time bombs, set to go off without warning.
Our nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in the pursuit
of two great objectives. First, we will shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist
plans, and bring terrorists to justice. And, second, we must prevent the terrorists and
regimes who seek chemical, biological or nuclear weapons from threatening the
United States and the world.
We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors
the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass
destruction. We will develop and deploy effective missile defenses to protect
America and our allies from sudden attack. And all nations should know: America
will do what is necessary to ensure our nation’s security. We’ll be deliberate, yet
time is not on our side. I will not wait on events, while dangers gather. I will not
stand by, as peril draws closer and closer. The United States of America will not
permit the world’s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world’s most
destructive weapons.
LESLIE PALTI AND TARIQ RAMADAN
The first document below, by an international relations expert, Leslie Palti, sums up
United Nations discussions. Published in 2006, it is not an official U.N. statement.

The second document is also from 2006, an article by the Swiss Muslim Tariq
Ramadan, a leading European Muslim intellectual who earlier had been offered a
faculty position by Notre Dame University that he had been unable to assume
because the U.S. government would not allow him to enter the country.
•••
LESLIE PALTI

The United Nations unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms as a violation
of human rights. However, finding a rights-based approach to fighting it has been
less obvious. The anti-terrorism debate hinges on finding the right balance between
human rights protection and effective security measures. Are effective counter
terrorism measures compatible with the full respect for fundamental freedoms? Is it
necessary for States to make compromises and infringe on the rule of law in order to
better protect their population from the threat of terrorism? In November 2002,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan noted that the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks
have exacerbated the dilemma, “where an understandable focus on preventing still
more terrible terrorist acts has increased concerns about the price we must pay in
terms of cherished rights and liberties.” He added: “We face a nearly unsolvable
conflict between two imperatives of modern life—protecting the traditional civil
liberties of our citizens, and at the same time ensuring their safety from terrorist
attacks with catastrophic consequences.” Particular attention needed to be given to
balancing anti-terrorism measures and the observance of human rights standards,
Mr. Annan said, otherwise the fight against terrorism would be “self-defeating.” For
the United Nations, respect for human rights remains an integral part of any
comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy. UN guidelines to help States strike a
balance between human rights and combating terrorism have been established in a
number of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, Security Council and
Commission on Human Rights. These resolutions stress that “States must ensure that
any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under
international law and should adopt such measure in accordance with international
law.”
The Challenge of Defining Terrorism

Fighting terrorism has been a long-standing concern of the General Assembly.
Beginning in 1963, the United Nations has focused on building a legal framework to
eliminate international terrorism and, to date, there are twelve major multilateral
conventions about terrorism that constitute the main element of international law.
However, despite this progress, one of the central challenges facing the Assembly has
been the definition of terrorism itself. Each of the twelve conventions relies on an
“operational” definition, based on specific terrorist “activities.” Thus, separate
treaties exist to address issues such as bombings, hijackings, hostage-taking and
covert financing of terrorist activities, but a universal definition has yet to be
adopted.
Since 1996, the Assembly’s Sixth (Legal) Committee has worked on drafting a
comprehensive convention on international terrorism, which will include a
definition of terrorism. However, negotiations remain stalled due to disagreements
between States on how to distinguish liberation movements from terrorist cells.
Thus, until States resolve the adage that “one man’s terrorist is another man’s
freedom fighter,” the debate over a universal definition of terrorism will continue.
TARIQ RAMADAN, “THE GLOBAL IDEOLOGY OF FEAR”

When we examine the countries of the West or those of the South, particularly where
the population is primarily Muslim, we can only conclude that fear is omnipresent
and deeply ingrained. It is having an unmistakable impact on the way human beings
perceive the world. We can observe at street level three principle effects:
First, fear, naturally and often unconsciously, breeds mistrust and potential
conflict with the “Other.” A binary vision of reality begins to impose the outlines of
a protective “us” and of a threatening “them.”
The second effect derives form the absolute domination of emotions in our
relationships with the Other and of emotional responses to events. When fear rules,
emotions undermine rational analysis. In such a state, we condemn the consequences
of some actions and reject the individuals who commit it, but we don’t seek to
understand what led to such action.…
If we broaden our focus, we see a world that reflects these same considerations
and postures. The “war” that has been unleashed to destroy terrorism is now
founded on the same logical bases, but on a global scale.
Don’t get me wrong. Terror is a fact, not an ideology, and the killing of innocent
people must be condemned with no exception. It is the ideological use of its
consequences that is problematic. The American neo-conservatives and their
European imitators instigate and nurture a permanent sense of fear, which they
wield as though it were an ideology. Their policies are based on a feeling of
insecurity and a binary vision of the world. The imperative is one of self-protection,
sometimes through draconian security policies that are hostile to freedom and, for
some, openly unjust and discriminatory. After all, the West has become the
“principal victim of terrorism.”
We must break the bonds of our fear, master our impulse to see things only in
black and white and recapture our critical spirit and our ability to listen. We must
once more become thinking “subjects”—that and nothing else. And yet, to do so
seems so difficult.
Muslims, whether they live in the West or in primarily Muslim countries, cannot
under any circumstances endorse the ideology of fear, nor can they fall into the trap
of a polarized, simplistic and caricatured reading of the world. By perpetuating the
idea, which has now become an obsession, that they are either dominated (or
members of a minority) and unappreciated or singled out and marginalized, they
unconsciously accept the premises of those who propagate this emotion-based
ideology, of those who seek to build walls and dig trenches, of those who promote
prejudices, fuel insecurity and fan the fires of conflict. These propagandists of fear
tirelessly spread the idea that Islam and Muslims are threatened by the future; by
allowing themselves to be swept into a vicious circle of self-justification and
defensiveness, Muslims confirm and lend credence to a debate whose terms have
been deliberately skewed.…
We must make an effort to educate ourselves in order to bring together the search
for meaning and for God and respect for the principles of justice, freedom and
human fraternity. Against the temptation to close ourselves off, to see reality in
black and white, we need an “intellectual jihad.” We need to resist (jihad means,
literally, effort and resistance), to strive for the universality of a message that

CHAPTER 36
GLOBAL WARMING AND GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTALISM
Humans have affected the environment at least since the beginning of agriculture,
sometimes with disastrous consequences. Industrialization in the nineteenth century
accelerated the potential for environmental change, with deteriorations of air
quality around factory centers and massive chemical spills running into rivers.
Industrialization also indirectly prompted new environmental developments outside
the industrial world, as planters scrambled to introduce crops like cotton or coffee
in regions where they might worsen soil quality or encourage new erosion. With all
this, it was only in the later twentieth century that humankind developed the
indisputable capacity to affect global environmental conditions, and not just
regional patterns. Efforts to distribute pollution through giant smokestacks, for
example, produced acid rain that might damage forests in distant areas—thus
Germany could affect Scandinavia and the American Midwest could touch Canada
and New England.
Increased production of carbon dioxide and the reduction of tropical rain forests
combined, in the judgment of most experts, to begin to raise the temperature of the
earth, probably as early as the nineteenth century and certainly by the twentieth
century. Concern mounted about possible increases in the levels of oceans, damage
to a variety of species, and possibly more violent weather, all as a result of what
became known as global warming.
Also in the later twentieth century, new kinds of global political efforts became
possible to address climate issues. The United Nations and other agencies called
conferences and encouraged new agreements to reduce air pollution.
Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) like Greenpeace arose to stimulate world
opinion and policymakers to take a more constructive environmental role.
(Greenpeace was founded in 1971, initially to resist nuclear testing; its
environmental concerns shifted by 2000.) Key international initiatives included the
Kyoto agreements, from 1997, setting limits on greenhouse gas emissions by the
industrial nations; these agreements had been ratified by over 150 countries by 2006
—including Japan, Russia, and the European Union—but the United States held
back.
All this occurred amid ongoing debate and some striking differences in levels of
concern. Scientists did not always agree with each other on the data involved.
Politicians and general publics varied in their response. Among other things, an
obvious gulf arose between the United States and other industrial societies that
produced mutual bad feeling and prevented full international accord.
The following documents suggest some of the positions involved, ranging from
environmental advocacy to official American resistance. There are three sets: first,
two scholars, writing in the 1990s, set up obviously contrasting views of recent
global experience and global prospects. Then more recent materials raise the policy
issues associated with global warming directly. Comparison in this sense is
straightforward, but it invites more subtle analysis about the extent of basic
differences, about the reasons for the differences, and, possibly, about how the
differences might be resolved. Finally, a third set provides recent data on pollutant
emissions and opinion polls.

Questions
1. What are the main contrasts between the approaches of Simon and Myers? How
can two presumably reasonable scholars disagree so completely?
2. How does current American environmental policy compare to the positions of
Simon and of Myers?
3. What are the key reasons American policymakers have resisted global calls for
international agreements to reduce pollutant emission?
4. What is the role of NGOs like Greenpeace in the environmental debate? How do
Greenpeace’s goals compare to those of the United States?
5. What is the relationship between policy and policy statements, on one hand, and
actual levels of pollution, on the other?
6. How do international opinion polls relate to different national policies? Which
comes first, the policy or the public attitude?
For Further Discussion
1. Why are Americans less concerned about global warming than people in most
other parts of the world?
2. Are there ways to reconcile the American and the international approaches? Is the
disagreement significant for United States’s interests?
3. How does modern environmental history fit into world history more generally?
How does it fit into a historical understanding of globalization?
A BASIC DEBATE
Julian Simon is a professor of business administration in the United States who has
written widely on issues of population growth. Norman Myers, British born but
partly educated in the United States, works mainly on the preservation of animal
species; he has served as advisor to the World Bank and the World Wildlife
Association. The debate from which the following materials derive was held at
Columbia University in 1992.
•••
JULIAN SIMON

The gloom-and-doom about a “crisis” of our environment is all wrong on the
scientific facts. Even the Environmental Protection Agency acknowledges that our air
and water have been getting cleaner rather than dirtier in the past few decades.
Every agricultural economist knows that the world’s population has been eating ever
better since World War II. Every resource economist knows that all natural resources
have been getting more available rather than more scarce, as shown by their falling
prices over the decades and centuries. And every demographer knows that the death
rate has been falling all over the world—life expectancy almost tripling in the rich
countries in the past two centuries, and almost doubling in the poor countries in just
the past four decades.
The picture also is now clear that population growth does not hinder economic
development. In the 1980s there was a complete reversal in the consensus of
thinking of population economists about the effects of more people. In 1986, the
National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences completely
overturned their “official” view away from the earlier worried view expressed in

1971. They noted the absence of any statistical evidence of a negative connection
between population increase and economic growth. And they said that “The scarcity
of exhaustible resources is at most a minor restraint on economic growth.”…
The most important and amazing demographic fact—the greatest human
achievement in history, in my view—is the decrease in the world’s death rate.…
Let’s put it differently. In the nineteenth century, the planet Earth could sustain
only 1 billion people. Ten thousand years ago, only 4 million could keep themselves
alive. Now, more than 5 billion people are living longer and more healthily than
ever before, on average. The increase in the world’s population represents our
victory over death.
I would expect lovers of humanity to jump with joy at this triumph of human
mind and organization over the killing forces of nature. Instead, many lament that
there are so many people alive to enjoy the gift of life. Some even express regret
over the fall in the death rate.…
From Norman Myers and Julian L. Simon, Scarcity or Abundance? A Debate on the
Environment (New York, W.W. Norton, 1994).
So by any measure, natural resources have been getting more available rather
than more scarce.
When we take a long-run view, the picture is different, and considerably more
complex, from the simple short run view of more people implying lower average
income. In the very long run, more people almost surely imply more available
resources and a higher income for everyone.
I suggest you test this proposition as follows:
Do you think that our standard of living would be as high as it is now if the
population had never grown from about 4 million human beings perhaps 10,000
years ago? I don’t think we’d now have electric light or gas heat or autos or
penicillin or travel to the Moon or our present life expectancy of over seventy years
at birth in rich countries—in comparison to the life expectancy of twenty to twentyfive years at birth in earlier eras—if population had not grown to its present
numbers. If population had never grown, instead of the pleasant lunch you had, you
would have been chasing rabbits and digging roots.
NORMAN MYERS

I believe that, by contrast with Julian Simon, we are at a watershed in human
history because of the grand-scale environmental degradation that is overtaking our
planet in conjunction with excessive population growth and consumerism. Unless we
change these trends and patterns, we are going to have a tough time of it. And not
only us, but dozens and hundreds of human generations into the future. In fact, in
the case of mass extinction of species, as many as 200,000 generations to come will
be impoverished because of what we are doing during the present few decades.…
What do I mean when I speak of prospective environmental ruin worldwide? Let
me give you a few quick statistics, all of them supported by reports from the World
Bank, United Nations agencies, the Rockefeller Foundation, and organizations of
similar reputable sort. Soil erosion: during the past year we have lost 25 billion tons
of topsoil around the world—and it’s as severe in parts of Indiana as in India. This
lost topsoil has cost us 9 million tons of grain, enough to make up the diets of well
over 200 million people who are “undernourished” (the jargon term for people who
are semi-starving). Also during the past year we have lost 150,000 square kilometers

of tropical forest, taking with them a host of watershed services. The economic costs
are sizeable: in the Ganges Valley alone in India, deforestation in the Himalayan
foothills causes downstream flooding that imposes costs that, according to the
Government of India, amount to well over $1 billion per year. During the past year,
too, desertification has totaled 60,000 square kilometers, taking out agricultural
lands with potential food output worth $42 billion.
Also during the past year, we have lost tens of thousands of species, again with an
economic cost. When you visit your neighborhood pharmacy, there is one chance in
two that the product on the counter before you would not be there if it were not for
startpoint materials from wild plants and animals. The commercial value of these
products is more than $40 billion a year. Think, then, of what we are losing when
we hear of tens of thousands of species disappearing every year.
In the past year too, we have depleted the ozone layer still further. We have taken
a solid step toward a greenhouse-affected world. And at the same time our Earth has
taken on board another 93 million people, equivalent to more than a “new
Mexico”—and this at a time when our Earth is straining under the burden of its
present population of 5.5 billion people.…
POLICY VIEWS
UNITED STATES

The two documents in this section involve a statement by President George W. Bush
in 2001 and a brief policy summary from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
in 2002.
•••
Text of a Letter from the President to Senators Hagel, Helms, Craig, and Roberts.

Thank you for your letter asking for the Administration’s views on global climate
change, in particular the Kyoto Protocol and efforts to regulate carbon dioxide
under the Clean Air Act. My Administration takes the issue of global climate change
very seriously.
As you know, I oppose the Kyoto Protocol because it exempts 80 percent of the
world, including major population centers such as China and India, from
compliance, and would cause serious harm to the U.S. economy. The Senate’s vote,
95-0, shows that there is a clear consensus that the Kyoto Protocol is an unfair and
ineffective means of addressing global climate change concerns.
As you also know, I support a comprehensive and balanced national energy policy
that takes into account the importance of improving air quality. Consistent with this
balanced approach, I intend to work with the Congress on a multipollutant strategy
to require power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and
mercury. Any such strategy would include phasing in reductions over a reasonable
period of time, providing regulatory certainty, and offering market-based incentives
to help industry meet the targets. I do not believe, however, that the government
should impose on power plants mandatory emissions reductions for carbon dioxide,
which is not a “pollutant” under the Clean Air Act.
From: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/03/20010314.html.
A recently released Department of Energy Report, “Analysis of Strategies for
Reducing Multiple Emissions from Power Plants,” concluded that including caps on

carbon dioxide emissions as part of a multiple emissions strategy would lead to an
even more dramatic shift from coal to natural gas for electric power generation and
significantly higher electricity prices compared to scenarios in which only sulfur
dioxide and nitrogen oxides were reduced.
This is important new information that warrants a reevaluation, especially at a
time of rising energy prices and a serious energy shortage. Coal generates more than
half of America’s electricity supply. At a time when California has already
experienced energy shortages, and other Western states are worried about price and
availability of energy this summer, we must be very careful not to take actions that
could harm consumers. This is especially true given the incomplete state of scientific
knowledge of the causes of, and solutions to, global climate change and the lack of
commercially available technologies for removing and storing carbon dioxide.
Consistent with these concerns, we will continue to fully examine global climate
change issues—including the science, technologies, market-based systems, and
innovative options for addressing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere. I am very optimistic that, with the proper focus and working with our
friends and allies, we will be able to develop technologies, market incentives, and
other creative ways to address global climate change.
I look forward to working with you and others to address global climate change
issues in the context of a national energy policy that protects our environment,
consumers, and economy.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
Environmental Protection Agency
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION’S ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY

The focus is on results—making our air, water, and land cleaner.
We need to employ the best science and data to inform our decision-making.
From
http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/environment/key_bush_environmental_accomplishments.pdf.
Our policies should encourage innovation and the development of new, cleaner
technologies.
We should continue to build on America’s ethic of stewardship and personal
responsibility through education and volunteer opportunies, and in our daily lives.
Opportunities for environmental improvements are not limited to Federal
Government actions—states, tribes, local communities, and individuals must be
included.
BUILDING ON OUR GREAT ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS

Over the last 30 years, our Nation has made great progress in providing for a better
environment and improving public health. In that time, our economy grew 164
percent, population grew 39 percent, and our energy consumption increased 42
percent, yet air pollution from the six major pollutants decreased by 48 percent. In
2002, state data reported to EPA showed that approximately 251 million people (or
94 percent of the total population) were served by community water systems that
met all health-based standards. This number is up from 79 percent in 1993.
JAPAN AND EUROPE

The Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nobutaka Machimura, provided remarks in
October 2005. A European Union statement was issued in 2006. Both statements
were addressed to international meetings on the environment.
MACHIMURA Nobutaka, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan On the occasion of the Fourth Informal Meeting on Further
Actions against Climate Change

Climate change is a serious and long-term challenge that has the potential to affect
every part of the globe, and human activities are contributing to the increases in
greenhouse gases. We all know that concrete and urgent actions are required to
arrest the rise of greenhouse gas emissions around the world. In February this year,
the Kyoto Protocol entered into force. This means all Annex I ratifiers of the
Protocol are now bound by the international law to meet their quantified
greenhouse gas emissions reduction under the Protocol. For our part, the
Government of Japan formulated the Kyoto Protocol Target Achievement Plan in
April in order to firmly achieve its reduction target of 6%. The Plan pursues the
balance between the environment and economic growth mainly through promoting
technological innovations, improving energy efficiency, and collaboration by all
stakeholders. Japan is strongly committed to meet its reduction goal.
From http://mofa.go.jp/policy/environment/warm/cop/message0510.html.
The Kyoto Protocol is an important step to tackle the issue of climate change, but
it is just a first step. We know further efforts have to be made for the long-term
mitigation of greenhouse gases, in order to meet the ultimate objective, namely, the
stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations at a safer level. To achieve this goal,
we must construct an encouraging and enabling framework, instead of a punitive
one, so that both developing and developed countries will play active roles in
intensive efforts to reduce greenhouse gases beyond the first commitment period of
the Kyoto Protocol.
European Union

The World Meteorological Organization recently issued a report indicating that
concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are
at their highest levels ever. There are many concrete signs that this is already having
consequences for climate and nature. The Artic ice is melting at an alarming rate.
Last September, the ice cap had retreated a record 250 km north of Alaska. If this
continues, there may be no ice at all during the summer of 2060. In this morning’s
edition of Le Soir, we can read of the Greenland ice disappearing much faster than
expected. With glaciers moving 2500 metres per year instead of 300 there is a real
possibility that the impact of climate change will be far worse than even our more
radical models.
The economic impacts are also vast. The Association of British Insurers estimates
that, by 2080, insured losses from hurricanes in the US alone could reach US$ 100–
150 billion a year. And the changing climate will radically modify the basis for
many of our core economic activities, such as agriculture, energy production and
transport.
The scientific debate about the human causes of climate change is largely settled.
Yet there remains an important gap between climate science and the global policy
response. We cannot afford such gap. I believe there is now a window of opportunity
to mobilize the world’s key leaders in favour of an alliance agaist climate change.
There is a high level of consensus on the need to act. Views still diverge on the
adequate policy and approach, but few still doubt the need for a global response to

climate change.
The EU is ready to engage in an open and constructive dialogue with all partners
and major emitting countries. We must seize this opportunity and together provide a
forward looking strategy for the future climate co-operation post-2012.
The EU will deliver on its climate policy and target of an 8% reduction in
emissions of greenhouse gases. By 2004, the EU had cut its emission by 1%. With the
additional measures planned in the second phase of the European Climate Change
Programme, we should meet our 8% target, and maybe even overshoot it. This
should be compared to significant emission increases in many parts of the world,
including the US.
With a share of only 14% in global greenhouse gas emissions, the EU cannot
resolve the problem on its own. But we are determined to demonstrate that proactive climate policies give results, and that they do not endanger economic growth.
…
Meeting the climate challenge requires efforts to reduce global emission by the
widest possible group of industrialized countries and major developing nations. We
of course expect the United States—as the world’s main emitter of greenhouse gases
with levels well above 1990—to take strong and resolute action on climate change,
and I believe there are encouraging signs on the other side of the Atlantic.
GREENPEACE

The following announcement was provided to the international press in November
2005.
•••
Time Is Running Out!

Greenpeace today unveiled a four metres tall hourglass outside the UN Climate
Change Conference in Montreal to remind the arriving delegates that time is running
out. The climate summit—the first since the Kyoto Protocol entered into force—
opens today, beginning two weeks of crucial negotiations on climate protection.
“Time is running out for the climate. Climate change is not a distant problem to
be dealt with sometime in the future. In fact we have very little time left to avoid
the most catastrophic impacts. Without prompt, decisive action from governments
here we will soon find ourselves riding a runaway train and it will be impossible to
apply the brakes,” said Stephanie Tunmore, Greenpeace International Climate
Campaigner in Montreal. If climate change goes unchecked many of its effects will
be irreversible. Glaciers in western China are expected to have largely disappeared
by 2100; summer sea ice in the Arctic could be lost well before the end of the
century according to some models, leaving polar bears, ice-dependent seals, walruses
and certain sea-birds facing extinction; and over the next several decades there is a
risk that regional climate changes combined with the effects of forest clearing could
flip the ecosystems of the Amazon from forest to grassland or desert.
Greenpeace believes that the goal of climate policy should be to keep global
average temperature rise to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, a position also
adopted by the European Union Heads of Government. It is still economically and
scientifically possible to do this with known technological means. The decisions
made in Montreal will determine whether or not those options remain viable.
From http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/releases/time-is-running-out.

Greenpeace also believes that by strengthening and expanding the Kyoto Protocol
for the next phase (2013–2017) a strong signal will be sent that will increase
confidence in the carbon market and encourage business to invest in low carbon
technology. The process for this should begin here in Montreal and be completed by
2008.
“The 156 Governments who have ratified the Kyoto Protocol now have the
obligation to show that they mean it. They must get on with negotiating the next
phase of Kyoto, with much stronger emission reduction targets for industrialised
countries. We hold this planet in trust for our children and our children’s children.
Are we really prepared to look them in the eye and say ‘Sorry, we just ran out of
time’?” concluded Tunmore.
Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses nonviolent,
creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems, and to force
solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.
